# Tutorial: Using Python for Genome Sequence Alignment with Biopython

## Question 
How can we perform genome sequence alignment using Python and the Biopython library to analyze genetic similarities?

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Biopython

First, ensure you have Biopython installed. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Required Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO, pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment
```

### Step 3: Load DNA Sequences

For this tutorial, let's assume we have two DNA sequences stored in FASTA files: `sequence1.fasta` and `sequence2.fasta`.

```python
# Load sequences from FASTA files
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

seq1 = load_sequences("sequence1.fasta")
seq2 = load_sequences("sequence2.fasta")
```

### Step 4: Perform Pairwise Alignment

We will use the `pairwise2` module to align the two sequences.

```python
def align_sequences(seq_a, seq_b):
    alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq_a, seq_b)
    return alignments

# Assuming you want to align the first entries from each loaded sequence
alignment_results = align_sequences(list(seq1.values())[0], list(seq2.values())[0])
```

### Step 5: Display Alignments

Let's format and display the best alignment.

```python
# Display the best alignment
for alignment in alignment_results:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Step 6: Analyze Alignment Results

You can analyze the alignment score and percentage identity as follows:

```python
def analyze_alignment(alignments):
    best_alignment = alignments[0]
    score = best_alignment[2]
    seqA = best_alignment[0]
    seqB = best_alignment[1]
    identity = (seqA.count('|') / len(seqA)) * 100

    print(f"Score: {score}")
    print(f"Percentage Identity: {identity:.2f}%")

analyze_alignment(alignment_results)
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial shows how to perform genome sequence alignment using Python's Biopython. By aligning two sequences, you can derive insights into genetic similarities and differences, which is essential in bioinformatics research.
