# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and identify genetic variants?

## Solution

### Step 1: Set up the environment

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Load necessary libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from collections import defaultdict
```

### Step 3: Read genomic sequences

Assuming you have a FASTA file (`genome_sequences.fasta`) with genomic sequences:

```python
def load_sequences(file):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

genomes = load_sequences("genome_sequences.fasta")
```

### Step 4: Identify variants

Let’s define a function that identifies Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) between two sequences:

```python
def find_variants(seq1, seq2):
    variants = []
    for i in range(min(len(seq1), len(seq2))):
        if seq1[i] != seq2[i]:
            variants.append((i, seq1[i], seq2[i]))
    return variants
```

### Step 5: Compare two genomes

Assuming `genome1` and `genome2` are two genomic sequences from the previously loaded genomes:

```python
genome1 = genomes['genome1_id']
genome2 = genomes['genome2_id']

variants = find_variants(genome1, genome2)
print("Identified SNPs:")
for position, ref, alt in variants:
    print(f"Position: {position}, Reference: {ref}, Alternate: {alt}")
```

### Step 6: Store results

To store the identified SNPs in a CSV file:

```python
import csv

def save_variants(variants, filename):
    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(["Position", "Reference", "Alternate"])
        writer.writerows(variants)

save_variants(variants, "identified_snps.csv")
```

### Conclusion

You now have a script that loads genomic sequences, identifies SNPs between two genomes, and saves the results in a CSV file. Adjust the file names and IDs as per your dataset.
