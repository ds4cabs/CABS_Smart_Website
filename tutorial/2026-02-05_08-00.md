# Using Python for Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Gene Expression Analysis

## Question
How can we build a machine learning model to classify cancer types based on gene expression data?

## Solution

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Step 2: Load Gene Expression Data

Assuming that you have a CSV file named `gene_expression.csv`, where rows represent samples and columns represent gene expression levels with a target column for cancer types.

```python
# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Preprocess the Data

Split the data into features and target, and then into training and testing sets.

```python
# Define features and target
X = data.drop('CancerType', axis=1)
y = data['CancerType']

# Split the dataset into training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 4: Build the Machine Learning Model

Use a Random Forest Classifier for classification.

```python
# Initialize and fit the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 5: Make Predictions

Predict the cancer types for the test set.

```python
# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model

Use classification report and confusion matrix for evaluation.

```python
# Classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Python and advanced machine learning techniques to classify cancer types based on gene expression data. You can explore other classifiers and tuning techniques to optimize the model further.
