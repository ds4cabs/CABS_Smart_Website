# Tutorial: Predicting Protein Structure Using AlphaFold via Python

## Question:
How can we use AlphaFold to predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence in Python?

## Solution:

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `tensorflow` libraries
- AlphaFold model and corresponding data

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
```

### Step 2: Download AlphaFold

You need to clone the AlphaFold GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold.git
cd alphafold
```

### Step 3: Prepare Input Data

Create a FASTA file (`input.fasta`) with the protein sequence to be predicted:

```plaintext
>Protein_Name
MVHLTPEEKSAVTALWGKVNIKRV
```

### Step 4: Load AlphaFold Model

Here is a Python script to load the model and predict the structure.

```python
import os
import sys
from alphafold import protein

# Function to predict the protein structure
def predict_structure(fasta_path: str):
    # Initialize AlphaFold model
    model = protein.AlphaFold()
    
    # Load the amino acid sequence from the FASTA file
    with open(fasta_path, 'r') as fasta_file:
        sequence = ""
        for line in fasta_file:
            if not line.startswith('>'):
                sequence += line.strip()
    
    # Predict the structure
    predictions = model.predict(sequence)
    return predictions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fasta_file = "input.fasta"
    
    if not os.path.exists(fasta_file):
        print(f"FASTA file {fasta_file} not found!")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    structure = predict_structure(fasta_file)
    print("Predicted Structure:", structure)
```

### Step 5: Visualizing the Structure

You can visualize the predicted structure using a library such as PyMOL. Install it via:

```bash
sudo apt install pymol
```

### Visualization Code (optional)

To create a file for PyMOL visualization:

```python
def save_structure_visualization(structure, output_file="predicted_structure.pdb"):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        file.write(structure)  # Save the structure to a file

# Call this function after predicting the structure
save_structure_visualization(structure)
```

### Running the Tutorial

1. Place your `input.fasta` in the same directory.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python predict_protein_structure.py
```
