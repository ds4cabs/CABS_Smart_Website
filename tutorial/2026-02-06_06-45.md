# How can we use Python for Gene Sequence Analysis in Bioinformatics?

Gene sequence analysis is a pivotal application in bioinformatics. In this tutorial, we will use Python along with the Biopython library to perform basic gene sequence analysis, including reading a FASTA file, extracting sequences, and calculating some basic statistics.

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Biopython

First, ensure you have Biopython installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Load a FASTA File

In this example, we will read a FASTA file containing gene sequences. Create a file named `sequences.fasta` with the following content:

```
>gene1
ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG
>gene2
GCTAGCTAGCTAGCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG
```

### Step 3: Python Script for Gene Sequence Analysis

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

# Function to read sequences from a FASTA file and get statistics
def analyze_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = []
    total_length = 0
    count = 0
    
    # Read sequences from the FASTA file
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(record.seq)
        total_length += len(record.seq)
        count += 1
        print(f"ID: {record.id}, Sequence: {record.seq}, Length: {len(record.seq)}")
    
    # Calculate average length
    average_length = total_length / count if count > 0 else 0
    
    print(f"\nTotal sequences: {count}")
    print(f"Total nucleotides: {total_length}")
    print(f"Average sequence length: {average_length:.2f}")

# Usage
analyze_sequences("sequences.fasta")
```

### Step 4: Running the Script

To run the script, save it in a file named `analyze_sequences.py` and execute it:

```bash
python analyze_sequences.py
```

### Output Explanation

When the script is run, it will output:

```
ID: gene1, Sequence: ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG, Length: 22
ID: gene2, Sequence: GCTAGCTAGCTAGCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG, Length: 30

Total sequences: 2
Total nucleotides: 52
Average sequence length: 26.00
```

### Conclusion

This simple Python script demonstrates how to read and analyze gene sequences using the Biopython library. You can extend this analysis by adding more functionality, such as DNA/protein translation or motif searching.
