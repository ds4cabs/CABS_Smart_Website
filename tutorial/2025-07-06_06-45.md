## Question

How can we use Python to perform advanced AI techniques for analyzing biological sequences, such as DNA, for pattern recognition and classification?

## Solution

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Python with libraries like `Biopython` for data handling and `scikit-learn` for machine learning to classify DNA sequences based on their motifs.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install biopython scikit-learn pandas
   ```

2. Have a dataset of DNA sequences. For this example, we will use a sample dataset.

### Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
```

### Step 2: Load and Preprocess Data

Assume we have a file `dna_sequences.fasta` with the following structure:

```
>sequence1
AGCTAGCTAGCT
>sequence2
CGTACGTACGTA
>sequence3
TGCATGCATGCA
```

```python
# Load DNA sequences
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
    return sequences

# Load your whether the sequence is exonic or intronic (example labels)
def load_labels():
    return ['exonic', 'intronic', 'exonic']  # Example labels

# Main execution
sequences = load_sequences('dna_sequences.fasta')
labels = load_labels()
```

### Step 3: Feature Extraction

We'll use a simple feature extraction method: counting nucleotide occurrences.

```python
def extract_features(sequences):
    features = []
    for seq in sequences:
        features.append([
            seq.count('A'),
            seq.count('C'),
            seq.count('G'),
            seq.count('T')
        ])
    return pd.DataFrame(features, columns=['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'])

# Create feature dataframe
features_df = extract_features(sequences)
```

### Step 4: Encoding Labels

We need to encode the labels for classification.

```python
encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = encoder.fit_transform(labels)
```

### Step 5: Train-Test Split

Split the data into training and test sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_df, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 6: Train the Model

We will use a random forest classifier for this example.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model

Finally, we can evaluate the model's performance on the test data.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=encoder.classes_))
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial covered how to load DNA sequences, extract features, encode labels, and build a machine learning model to classify biological sequences. You can extend this framework with more complex features or use other AI techniques as necessary.
