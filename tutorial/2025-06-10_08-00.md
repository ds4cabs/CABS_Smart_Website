# Tutorial: Advanced AI in Bioinformatics - Predicting Protein Structure

## Question
How can we use machine learning to predict the tertiary structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence?

## Solution
In this tutorial, we will use Python with the help of libraries like `Biopython`, `scikit-learn`, and `numpy` to create a predictive model based on historical protein data. 

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install biopython scikit-learn numpy pandas
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
```

### Step 3: Load and Preprocess Data
Assuming that you have a dataset named `protein_data.fasta` in FASTA format.

```python
def load_protein_data(fasta_file):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
    return sequences

sequences = load_protein_data("protein_data.fasta")

# Sample process to create feature vectors and labels
def create_features_labels(sequences):
    features = []
    labels = []  # Assuming you have corresponding labels for your sequences

    for seq in sequences:
        # Example: Calculate amino acid composition
        aa_count = {aa: seq.count(aa) for aa in 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'}
        features.append(list(aa_count.values()))
        labels.append('Label')  # Replace with actual label extraction logic
        
    return np.array(features), np.array(labels)

features, labels = create_features_labels(sequences)
```

### Step 4: Split Data
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Train the Model
```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Make Predictions
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model
```python
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Conclusion
You have successfully trained a machine learning model to predict protein structure based on amino acid sequences. You can now refine your model, use different algorithms or input features to improve performance.
