# Question: How can we use Python for sequence alignment in bioinformatics?

## Solution

In bioinformatics, sequence alignment is crucial for comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to identify similarities and differences. One popular method is the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment. Here’s how to implement this algorithm using Python.

### Requirements

Make sure you have the `numpy` library installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2, match=1, mismatch=-1, gap=-2):
    # Create score matrix
    n = len(seq1) + 1
    m = len(seq2) + 1
    score_matrix = np.zeros((n, m))

    # Initialize scoring matrix
    for i in range(1, n):
        score_matrix[i][0] = i * gap
    for j in range(1, m):
        score_matrix[0][j] = j * gap

    # Fill the scoring matrix
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m):
            if seq1[i-1] == seq2[j-1]:
                score = match
            else:
                score = mismatch
            score_matrix[i][j] = max(
                score_matrix[i-1][j] + gap,
                score_matrix[i][j-1] + gap,
                score_matrix[i-1][j-1] + score
            )

    # Traceback to get aligned sequences
    aligned_seq1 = ""
    aligned_seq2 = ""
    i, j = n-1, m-1

    while i > 0 or j > 0:
        current_score = score_matrix[i][j]
        if i > 0 and score_matrix[i-1][j] + gap == current_score:
            aligned_seq1 += seq1[i-1]
            aligned_seq2 += "-"
            i -= 1
        elif j > 0 and score_matrix[i][j-1] + gap == current_score:
            aligned_seq1 += "-"
            aligned_seq2 += seq2[j-1]
            j -= 1
        else:
            aligned_seq1 += seq1[i-1]
            aligned_seq2 += seq2[j-1]
            i -= 1
            j -= 1

    return aligned_seq1[::-1], aligned_seq2[::-1]

# Example usage
seq1 = "AGCT"
seq2 = "AGT"
aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2 = needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2)

print(f"Aligned Sequences:\n{aligned_seq1}\n{aligned_seq2}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Scoring Matrix Initialization**: Initializes the scoring matrix with gap penalties for leading gaps in each sequence.
2. **Matrix Filling**: Fills the matrix based on match/mismatch and gap penalties.
3. **Traceback**: Determines the optimal alignment by backtracking through the matrix.
4. **Output**: Prints the aligned sequences. 

This basic implementation can be expanded with more complex features such as affine gap penalties or local alignment methods.
