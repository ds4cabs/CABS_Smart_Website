# Question: How can we use Python to perform genomic data analysis with advanced AI techniques?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python to analyze genomic data and apply machine learning techniques for gene expression classification. We will use the `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `tensorflow` libraries to achieve this.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Step 2: Load the Data

We will use a public gene expression dataset. For this example, let's assume we have a CSV file called `gene_expression.csv`.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Preprocess the Data

We need to separate features and labels, normalize the features, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Assume the last column is the label
X = data.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = data.iloc[:, -1].values

# Normalize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 4: Build the Model

We will create a simple neural network using TensorFlow/Keras for classification.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Build the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # For binary classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Step 5: Train the Model

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=30, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model

```python
# Evaluate the model on the test set
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}')
```

### Step 7: Make Predictions

```python
# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predicted_classes = (predictions > 0.5).astype("int32")

# Display predictions
print(predicted_classes)
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to perform genomic data analysis using advanced AI techniques with Python. We built, trained, evaluated, and made predictions using a neural network. You can further explore hyperparameter tuning, different architectures, and more complex datasets for improved results.
