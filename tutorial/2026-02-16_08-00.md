# Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions

## Question
How can we use machine learning techniques in Python to predict protein-protein interactions from genomic data?

## Solution

### Step 1: Import Libraries
We will use libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and keras for data manipulation and machine learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
```

### Step 2: Load Data
Assume we have a dataset `ppi_data.csv` with features and a binary label indicating interaction (1 for interaction, 0 for no interaction).

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('ppi_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Separate features and labels, and split the data into training and test sets.

```python
# Features and labels
X = data.drop('interaction', axis=1)
y = data['interaction']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardizing the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 4: Build the Neural Network Model
Create a sequential model with input, hidden, and output layers.

```python
# Build the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))  # Input Layer
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))  # Hidden Layer
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))  # Output Layer
```

### Step 5: Compile the Model
Compile the model using binary crossentropy loss and an optimizer.

```python
# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Step 6: Train the Model
Train the model with the training data.

```python
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=10)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate Model Performance
Evaluate the model using the test set to measure accuracy.

```python
# Evaluate model performance
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')
```

### Step 8: Make Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

```python
# Predict interactions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predictions = (predictions > 0.5).astype(int)

# Display predictions
print(predictions)
```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to build a simple neural network to predict protein-protein interactions using genomic data. This approach can be extended with more complex architectures or additional data preprocessing techniques for enhanced performance.
