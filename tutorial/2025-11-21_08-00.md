# Tutorial: Advanced AI in Bioinformatics using Python

## Question
How can we use AI to predict protein structure using deep learning in bioinformatics?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we'll implement a deep learning model to predict protein structure from amino acid sequences using the Keras library in Python.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have the following libraries installed. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas keras tensorflow biopython
```

### Step 2: Data Preparation

We will use the Protein Data Bank (PDB) dataset. For this example, assume we have a dataset called `proteins.csv` with the following columns: `sequence` and `structure`.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('proteins.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Convert amino acid sequences to numerical representations.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Mapping amino acids to integers
amino_acids = 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'
aa_dict = {aa: i for i, aa in enumerate(amino_acids)}

# Convert sequences to numerical
data['encoded_sequences'] = data['sequence'].apply(lambda x: [aa_dict[aa] for aa in x if aa in aa_dict])

# Padding sequences to have the same length
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

max_length = 100  # Define max length for padding
X = pad_sequences(data['encoded_sequences'], maxlen=max_length, padding='post')
y = data['structure']  # Assuming structure is already numerical encoded
```

### Step 4: Building the Model

We will create a simple LSTM model to perform the predictions.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding, Dropout

# Model definition
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=len(amino_acids), output_dim=64, input_length=max_length))
model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(LSTM(64))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))  # Output layer

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Display model summary
model.summary()
```

### Step 5: Training the Model

Train the model using the prepared dataset.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

### Step 6: Evaluating the Model

After training, evaluate the model's performance.

```python
# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {loss:.4f}, Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')
```

### Step 7: Making Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on new protein sequences.

```python
# Predicting on new data
new_sequences = ['ACDEFGHIKLMNPQ']  # Example sequence
new_encoded = pad_sequences([[aa_dict[aa] for aa in seq if aa in aa_dict] for seq in new_sequences], maxlen=max_length, padding='post')

predictions = model.predict(new_encoded)
print(predictions)
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we built a deep learning model to predict protein structure from amino acid sequences using Keras. With appropriate datasets and tuning, this model can be advanced for better accuracy and functionality.
