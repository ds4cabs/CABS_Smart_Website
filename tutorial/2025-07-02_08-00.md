# Question
How can we use Python to perform advanced AI tasks in bioinformatics, specifically for predicting protein structures using deep learning?

# Solution
In this tutorial, we will implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to predict protein structures from amino acid sequences. We will use a dataset containing protein sequences and their corresponding 3D coordinates.

## Requirements
Before we start, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy biopython
```

## Step 1: Data Preparation
We will load and preprocess a dataset of protein sequences. For simplicity, we will create a mock dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Mock dataset creation
data = {
    'sequence': ['ACDEFGHIK', 'LMNPQRSTVW', 'YACDEGISL', 'KQRRCTWFGH'],
    'coordinates': [np.random.rand(9, 3) for _ in range(4)]  # Random 3D coordinates
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert sequences to numerical representation (e.g., one-hot encoding)
def sequence_to_one_hot(sequence):
    amino_acids = 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'
    return np.array([[1 if aa == char else 0 for aa in amino_acids] for char in sequence])

X = np.array([sequence_to_one_hot(seq) for seq in df['sequence']])
y = np.array(df['coordinates'].tolist()).reshape(len(df), -1)  # Flatten coordinates

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
```

## Step 2: Building the CNN Model
Now, we will create and compile a Convolutional Neural Network model.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

# Create the CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv1D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(y_train.shape[1])  # Output layer for 3D coordinates
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
```

## Step 3: Training the Model
Now we will train the model on our training dataset.

```python
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=2, validation_split=0.2)
```

## Step 4: Evaluating the Model
After training, we will evaluate our model on the test dataset.

```python
# Evaluate the model
loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {loss}')
```

## Step 5: Making Predictions
Finally, we can make predictions on new protein sequences.

```python
# Making predictions
new_sequences = ['ACDEFGHIJKLM', 'LMNPQRST']
new_X = np.array([sequence_to_one_hot(seq) for seq in new_sequences])
predictions = model.predict(new_X)

for seq, pred in zip(new_sequences, predictions):
    print(f'Sequence: {seq}\nPredicted Coordinates: {pred.reshape(-1, 3)}\n')
```

This code demonstrates how to build a simple deep learning model for protein structure prediction in bioinformatics. Adjustments can be made to improve model accuracy, such as using different architectures or hyperparameters.
