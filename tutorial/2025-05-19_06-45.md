# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for identifying SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in bioinformatics?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we'll use Python along with the Biopython library to analyze genomic sequences and identify SNPs. We'll read in a genomic sequence, compare it to a reference sequence, and identify positions where the sequences differ.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Biopython installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.Align import MultipleSeqAlignment
from collections import defaultdict
```

## Step 2: Load Genomic Sequences

Let's assume you have a reference sequence and several variants stored in a FASTA file. 

```python
def load_sequences(reference_file, variant_file):
    reference_seq = SeqIO.read(reference_file, "fasta")
    variants = SeqIO.parse(variant_file, "fasta")
    return reference_seq, variants

reference_seq, variants = load_sequences("reference.fasta", "variants.fasta")
```

## Step 3: Identify SNPs

We will compare the reference sequence to each variant sequence to find SNPs.

```python
def identify_snps(reference, variants):
    snp_positions = defaultdict(list)
    
    for variant in variants:
        snps = []
        for i in range(len(reference.seq)):
            if reference.seq[i] != variant.seq[i]:
                snps.append((i + 1, reference.seq[i], variant.seq[i]))  # Store position, ref, and variant
        snp_positions[variant.id] = snps
    
    return snp_positions

snp_results = identify_snps(reference_seq, variants)
```

## Step 4: Print the Results

Finally, let's print out the identified SNPs for each variant.

```python
def print_snp_results(snp_results):
    for variant_id, snps in snp_results.items():
        print(f"Variant: {variant_id}")
        for position, ref_base, var_base in snps:
            print(f"Position: {position}, Reference: {ref_base}, Variant: {var_base}")
        print("\n")

print_snp_results(snp_results)
```

## Complete Code

Here is the complete code in one block:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from collections import defaultdict

def load_sequences(reference_file, variant_file):
    reference_seq = SeqIO.read(reference_file, "fasta")
    variants = SeqIO.parse(variant_file, "fasta")
    return reference_seq, variants

def identify_snps(reference, variants):
    snp_positions = defaultdict(list)
    
    for variant in variants:
        snps = []
        for i in range(len(reference.seq)):
            if reference.seq[i] != variant.seq[i]:
                snps.append((i + 1, reference.seq[i], variant.seq[i]))  # Store position, ref, and variant
        snp_positions[variant.id] = snps
    
    return snp_positions

def print_snp_results(snp_results):
    for variant_id, snps in snp_results.items():
        print(f"Variant: {variant_id}")
        for position, ref_base, var_base in snps:
            print(f"Position: {position}, Reference: {ref_base}, Variant: {var_base}")
        print("\n")

# Usage
reference_seq, variants = load_sequences("reference.fasta", "variants.fasta")
snp_results = identify_snps(reference_seq, variants)
print_snp_results(snp_results)
```

This approach allows you to easily identify SNPs in genomic data. Modify the file paths as necessary to run with your data.
