# Question
How can we perform genomic sequence alignment using advanced AI techniques in Python?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will explore a method to perform genomic sequence alignment using the `Biopython` library and an advanced AI technique, namely using a pre-trained model for genomic sequences. We will focus on how to utilize the `transformers` library from Hugging Face for this purpose.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython transformers torch
```

## Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
```

## Step 2: Load the Pre-trained Model

We will use a pre-trained model for DNA sequence classification or alignment tasks.

```python
model_name = "Rostlab/prot_bert"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

## Step 3: Prepare Input Sequences

For this example, we will load genomic sequences from a FASTA file.

```python
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
    return sequences

file_path = "genomic_sequences.fasta"
sequences = load_sequences(file_path)
```

## Step 4: Tokenize Sequences

We will tokenize the sequences using the tokenizer we loaded earlier.

```python
def tokenize_sequences(sequences):
    return tokenizer(sequences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")

input_seq = tokenize_sequences(sequences)
```

## Step 5: Perform Alignment Using the Model

You can feed the tokenized sequences into the model to obtain embeddings or align sequences.

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**input_seq)
    
# Get the hidden states (embeddings) from the model
embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state
```

## Step 6: Interpret and Analyze Results

From the embeddings, you can compute similarities or perform clustering to analyze the alignment of genomic sequences.

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Compute cosine similarity between sequences
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings.numpy())

# Print or visualize the similarity matrix
print("Similarity Matrix:\n", similarity_matrix)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've demonstrated how to perform genomic sequence alignment using a transformer model in Python. This approach utilizes advanced AI techniques to provide insights into genomic data, leveraging pre-trained models for effective analysis.
