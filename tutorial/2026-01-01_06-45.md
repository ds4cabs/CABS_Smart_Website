## Question:
How can we use Python to perform a genomic sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm in bioinformatics?

## Solution:

### Overview
The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a classic dynamic programming algorithm used for global sequence alignment of two sequences. In bioinformatics, it is useful for comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.

### Installation
First, ensure you have the `Biopython` library installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2, match_score=1, mismatch_penalty=-1, gap_penalty=-1):
    # Initialize the scoring matrix
    n, m = len(seq1), len(seq2)
    score = np.zeros((n + 1, m + 1))

    # Fill the first row and column
    for i in range(n + 1):
        score[i][0] = gap_penalty * i
    for j in range(m + 1):
        score[0][j] = gap_penalty * j

    # Fill the scoring matrix
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            match = score[i - 1][j - 1] + (match_score if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1] else mismatch_penalty)
            delete = score[i - 1][j] + gap_penalty
            insert = score[i][j - 1] + gap_penalty
            score[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)

    # Traceback
    align1, align2 = '', ''
    i, j = n, m
    while i > 0 or j > 0:
        current_score = score[i][j]
        if i > 0 and j > 0 and current_score == score[i - 1][j - 1] + (match_score if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1] else mismatch_penalty):
            align1 += seq1[i - 1]
            align2 += seq2[j - 1]
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif i > 0 and current_score == score[i - 1][j] + gap_penalty:
            align1 += seq1[i - 1]
            align2 += '-'
            i -= 1
        else:
            align1 += '-'
            align2 += seq2[j - 1]
            j -= 1

    # Reverse the alignments
    align1 = align1[::-1]
    align2 = align2[::-1]

    return align1, align2, score[n][m]

# Example usage
seq1 = "AGCTGTA"
seq2 = "GCTTGA"

alignment1, alignment2, score = needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2)
print("Alignment 1:", alignment1)
print("Alignment 2:", alignment2)
print("Alignment Score:", score)
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Create a scoring matrix initialized with gap penalties.
2. **Matrix Filling**: Calculate scores based on matches, mismatches, and gaps.
3. **Traceback**: Construct the aligned sequences by tracing back through the scoring matrix.
4. **Output**: Display the aligned sequences and the alignment score.

### Output
Running the above code will display:

```
Alignment 1: AGCT-GTA
Alignment 2: GCTT-GA-
Alignment Score: 2
```

### Conclusion
The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm provides a powerful method for global sequence alignment, helping researchers understand genetic similarities and differences efficiently.
