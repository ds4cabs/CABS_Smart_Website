# Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Sequence Classification

## Question
How can we implement a machine learning model to classify biological sequences (such as DNA) into different functional categories using Python?

## Solution

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
First, we need to install and import essential libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.

```python
# Install required packages
!pip install biopython scikit-learn pandas

# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 2: Load Biological Sequence Data
Assume you have a FASTA file with sequences and their corresponding labels.

```python
# Load sequences from a FASTA file
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    labels = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
        labels.append(record.description.split()[1])  # Assuming the label is the second word
    return sequences, labels

sequences, labels = load_sequences('sequences.fasta')
```

### Step 3: Preprocess the Data
Convert sequences into a suitable feature representation.

```python
# Convert sequences to a bag-of-words model
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(analyzer='char', ngram_range=(2, 2))
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(sequences)
y = labels
```

### Step 4: Split the Data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Train a Machine Learning Model
Use a Naive Bayes classifier for the classification task.

```python
# Initialize and train the model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Predict and Evaluate
Make predictions on the test set and evaluate performance.

```python
# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to classify biological sequences using an advanced AI approach with Python. This includes loading sequence data, preprocessing, training a classifier, and obtaining performance metrics.
