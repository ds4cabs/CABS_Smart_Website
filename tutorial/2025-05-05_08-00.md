# Question: How can we use Python to analyze RNA-Seq data for differential gene expression?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python along with the `Pandas` and `Statsmodels` libraries to perform differential gene expression analysis on RNA-Seq data. We will focus on calculating the differential expression between two conditions.

### Step 1: Setup

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas statsmodels
```

### Step 2: Load Data

Assume we have a CSV file named `rna_seq_data.csv` with the following structure:

| Gene  | Condition1 | Condition2 |
|-------|------------|------------|
| GeneA | 100        | 150        |
| GeneB | 300        | 350        |
| GeneC | 40         | 30         |

We will read this data using Pandas.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the RNA-Seq data
data = pd.read_csv('rna_seq_data.csv')

# Display the loaded data
print(data)
```

### Step 3: Calculate Differential Expression

To calculate differential expression, we will use a simple approach using a t-test.

```python
from scipy import stats

# Initialize a list to store results
results = []

# Loop through each gene to perform a t-test
for index, row in data.iterrows():
    gene = row['Gene']
    condition1_counts = row['Condition1']
    condition2_counts = row['Condition2']
    
    # Perform t-test
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(
        [condition1_counts], [condition2_counts], equal_var=False)
    
    # Append results
    results.append({'Gene': gene, 't-statistic': t_stat, 'p-value': p_value})

# Convert results to a DataFrame
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Display results
print(results_df)
```

### Step 4: Adjust P-values

To correct for multiple testing, we can use the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

```python
from statsmodels.stats.multitest import multipletests

# Adjust p-values
results_df['Adjusted P-value'] = multipletests(results_df['p-value'], method='fdr_bh')[1]

# Display adjusted results
print(results_df)
```

### Conclusion

This script provides a basic framework for performing differential gene expression analysis on RNA-Seq data using Python. For more complex analyses, consider exploring specialized libraries such as `DESeq2` or `edgeR`, which are available in R and can be accessed via Python using `rpy2`.
