# Question: How can we use Python for sequence alignment in bioinformatics?

Sequence alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics that helps in identifying similarities and differences between biological sequences like DNA, RNA, or proteins. In this tutorial, we will explore how to perform sequence alignment using the Biopython library.

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Biopython

Make sure you have `Biopython` installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Required Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Align import PairwiseAligner
```

### Step 3: Load Sequences

For this example, we will use two DNA sequences. You can read them from a file or define them directly in the code.

```python
# Define two sequences
seq1 = "AGCTGAC"
seq2 = "AGCTGAA"
```

### Step 4: Perform Pairwise Alignment

We'll use `PairwiseAligner` to perform the alignment of the two sequences.

```python
# Create an aligner object
aligner = PairwiseAligner()

# Perform global alignment
alignment = aligner.align(seq1, seq2)

# Print alignment score and alignment
print("Alignment score:", alignment.score)

for a in alignment:
    print("Alignment:")
    print(a)  # Print the alignment in a human-readable format
```

### Step 5: Analyze the Alignment

After running the code, the output will show the alignment score and visualize the alignment, making it easier to interpret any similarities or differences between sequences.

### Complete Code

Here's the complete code for quick reference:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Align import PairwiseAligner

# Define two sequences
seq1 = "AGCTGAC"
seq2 = "AGCTGAA"

# Create an aligner object
aligner = PairwiseAligner()

# Perform global alignment
alignment = aligner.align(seq1, seq2)

# Print alignment score and alignment
print("Alignment score:", alignment.score)

for a in alignment:
    print("Alignment:")
    print(a)  # Print the alignment
```

### Conclusion

This simple tutorial highlighted how to perform sequence alignment using Python and Biopython. You can extend this method by working with larger datasets or different types of sequences and exploring alignment parameters such as scoring schemes and gap penalties.
