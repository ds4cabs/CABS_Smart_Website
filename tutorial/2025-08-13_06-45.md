# Question
How can we implement a Random Forest classifier to predict gene expression levels in bioinformatics using Python?

# Solution

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load dataset
# Assuming the dataset is a CSV file with the last column as the target variable (gene expression levels)
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression_data.csv')

# Check the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())

# Define features and target
X = data.iloc[:, :-1].values  # all columns except the last
y = data.iloc[:, -1].values    # last column

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize Random Forest Regressor
rf_regressor = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model
rf_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = rf_regressor.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

### Explanation
1. **Import Libraries**: We import necessary libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`), numerical operations (`numpy`), model training (`sklearn`), and evaluation.
  
2. **Load Dataset**: A CSV file containing gene expression data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. **Define Features and Target**: We separate the features and target variable where the last column represents gene expression levels.

4. **Split Data**: The dataset is divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.

5. **Model Initialization**: A Random Forest Regressor is initialized with 100 trees.

6. **Model Fitting**: The model is trained using the training subset.

7. **Predictions**: After training, predictions are made on the testing subset.

8. **Evaluation**: Finally, we evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Note
- Ensure that the dataset (`gene_expression_data.csv`) is available in the working directory and has the appropriate structure. 
- You may need to install necessary libraries using `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn` if not already installed.
