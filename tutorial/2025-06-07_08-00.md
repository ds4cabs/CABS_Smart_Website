# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and perform basic bioinformatics tasks?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will focus on how to analyze genomic sequences using Python, specifically leveraging the Biopython library. We will cover loading a genomic sequence, calculating its GC content, and finding the reverse complement of the sequence.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `Biopython` installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 1: Load the Genomic Sequence

We will start with a sample DNA sequence in a FASTA format.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

# Load the genomic sequence from a FASTA file
def load_sequence(fasta_file):
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        return record.seq

# Example usage
sequence = load_sequence("example.fasta")
print("Loaded Sequence:", sequence)
```

### Step 2: Calculate GC Content

Next, we will calculate the GC content of the genomic sequence. The GC content is the percentage of G and C nucleotides in the sequence.

```python
def gc_content(seq):
    g_count = seq.count("G")
    c_count = seq.count("C")
    gc_percentage = (g_count + c_count) / len(seq) * 100
    return gc_percentage

# Example usage
gc = gc_content(sequence)
print(f"GC Content: {gc:.2f}%")
```

### Step 3: Find Reverse Complement

Now, we will find the reverse complement of the genomic sequence. The reverse complement is created by reversing the sequence and replacing A with T, T with A, C with G, and G with C.

```python
def reverse_complement(seq):
    return seq.reverse_complement()

# Example usage
reverse_comp = reverse_complement(sequence)
print("Reverse Complement:", reverse_comp)
```

### Complete Script

Hereâ€™s the complete script that combines all the steps:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

def load_sequence(fasta_file):
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        return record.seq

def gc_content(seq):
    g_count = seq.count("G")
    c_count = seq.count("C")
    gc_percentage = (g_count + c_count) / len(seq) * 100
    return gc_percentage

def reverse_complement(seq):
    return seq.reverse_complement()

# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sequence = load_sequence("example.fasta")
    print("Loaded Sequence:", sequence)
    
    gc = gc_content(sequence)
    print(f"GC Content: {gc:.2f}%")
    
    reverse_comp = reverse_complement(sequence)
    print("Reverse Complement:", reverse_comp)
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to load a genomic sequence, calculate its GC content, and obtain its reverse complement using Biopython. These basic bioinformatics tasks can serve as the foundation for more complex analyses.
