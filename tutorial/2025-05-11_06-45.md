# Tutorial: Advanced AI in Bioinformatics Using Python

## Question:
How can we apply Machine Learning to predict protein secondary structure using sequence data?

## Solution:
In this tutorial, we will illustrate how to predict protein secondary structures (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, etc.) using a simple machine learning approach in Python. We will use the `BioPython` library for data handling and `scikit-learn` for modeling.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Install Required Libraries**
   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install biopython scikit-learn numpy pandas
   ```

2. **Import Libraries**
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   from Bio import SeqIO
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
   ```

3. **Load Data**
   For this tutorial, we will use the CB513 dataset, which contains protein sequences and their corresponding secondary structures.
   ```python
   def load_data(file_path):
       sequences = []
       structures = []
       for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
           sequences.append(str(record.seq))
           structures.append(record.description.split()[1])  # Assuming secondary structure is the second part
       return sequences, structures

   sequences, structures = load_data("cb513_sequences.fasta")
   ```

4. **Feature Extraction**
   Convert sequences into numerical features (e.g., k-mer frequency).
   ```python
   def kmer_features(sequences, k=3):
       features = []
       for seq in sequences:
           feature_vector = {}
           for i in range(len(seq) - k + 1):
               kmer = seq[i:i+k]
               if kmer in feature_vector:
                   feature_vector[kmer] += 1
               else:
                   feature_vector[kmer] = 1
           features.append(feature_vector)
       
       df = pd.DataFrame(features).fillna(0)  # Convert to DataFrame and fill NaNs
       return df

   feature_matrix = kmer_features(sequences)
   ```

5. **Preparation for Modeling**
   Encode secondary structure labels into numeric format.
   ```python
   label_mapping = {'H': 0, 'E': 1, 'C': 2}  # H: Alpha-Helix, E: Beta-Sheet, C: Coil
   labels = np.array([label_mapping[s] for s in structures])
   ```

6. **Train-Test Split**
   ```python
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(feature_matrix, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

7. **Model Training**
   ```python
   model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

8. **Model Evaluation**
   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
   print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
   ```

### Conclusion
We successfully built a machine learning model to predict protein secondary structure based on their sequences. This pipeline can be enhanced by tuning hyperparameters, optimizing feature extraction methods, or exploring alternative models. For real-world applications, larger datasets and advanced methodologies like deep learning could be employed for improved accuracy.
