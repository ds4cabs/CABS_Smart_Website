# Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions

## Question
How can we use Python to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using machine learning techniques with biological data?

## Solution

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

### Step 2: Load Biological Data

Assuming we have a CSV file `ppi_data.csv` containing features (e.g., sequence composition, structural properties) and labels (interaction or no interaction):

```python
data = pd.read_csv('ppi_data.csv')
features = data.drop('interaction', axis=1)
labels = data['interaction']
```

### Step 3: Preprocess the Data

Split the data into training and testing sets, and scale the features.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 4: Create the Model

Using a Random Forest Classifier for the prediction:

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 5: Make Predictions

Predict on the test data:

```python
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model

Check the accuracy and generate a classification report:

```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
report = classification_report(y_test, predictions)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
print('Classification Report:')
print(report)
```

### Conclusion

This Python script demonstrates how to predict protein-protein interactions using machine learning techniques. Adjustments can be made for feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance based on specific datasets.
