# Question
How can we use Python to perform advanced genomic sequence analysis using bioinformatics libraries?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will explore how to analyze genomic sequences using Python with the help of the `Biopython` library. We will focus on the following tasks:
1. Fetching genomic data from an online database.
2. Performing sequence alignment.
3. Analyzing sequence motifs.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Step 1: Fetching Genomic Data

We will use the `Entrez` module of `Biopython` to retrieve a nucleotide sequence from the NCBI database.

```python
from Bio import Entrez

# Set email for NCBI
Entrez.email = "your_email@example.com"

# Fetching the sequence
def fetch_sequence(accession_number):
    handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id=accession_number, rettype="gb", retmode="text")
    record = handle.read()
    handle.close()
    return record

# Example Accession Number
accession_number = "NC_000852"
sequence_record = fetch_sequence(accession_number)
print(sequence_record)
```

## Step 2: Sequence Alignment

Now let's perform a sequence alignment using the `pairwise2` module.

```python
from Bio import pairwise2

# Example sequences
seq1 = "AGCTGAC"
seq2 = "AGCTGTC"

# Performing sequence alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)
for alignment in alignments:
    print(pairwise2.format_alignment(*alignment))
```

## Step 3: Analyzing Sequence Motifs

In this step, we will search for specific motifs in our sequence using regular expressions.

```python
import re

def find_motif(sequence, motif):
    return re.finditer(motif, sequence)

# Example sequence and motif
sequence = "AGCTGACAGCTGTC"
motif = "GTC"

# Finding motifs
matches = find_motif(sequence, motif)
for match in matches:
    print(f"Motif found at position: {match.start()} - {match.end()} : {match.group()}")
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we fetched a genomic sequence from NCBI, performed sequence alignment, and analyzed motifs within the sequence using Python and the `Biopython` library. With these tools, advanced bioinformatics analyses can be conducted efficiently.
