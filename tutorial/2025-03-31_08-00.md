# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for identifying potential genetic variants linked to diseases?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will analyze genomic sequences using Python to identify potential genetic variants. We will utilize the `Biopython` library for handling biological computations and `pandas` for data manipulation.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install biopython pandas
```

### Step 1: Load genomic data

We will start by reading a genomic FASTA file containing sequences.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
import pandas as pd

# Load the genomic sequence data
fasta_file = 'genome_sequences.fasta'
sequences = list(SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"))

# Display the number of sequences loaded
print(f"Loaded {len(sequences)} sequences.")
```

### Step 2: Analyze variants

We will extract the sequences and identify potential SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) by comparing them to a reference sequence.

```python
# Define reference sequence for comparison (assuming the first sequence is the reference)
reference_sequence = sequences[0].seq

# Initialize a list to collect SNPs
snps = []

# Compare each sequence to the reference
for seq_record in sequences[1:]:
    variant_positions = []
    for pos in range(len(reference_sequence)):
        if reference_sequence[pos] != seq_record.seq[pos]:
            variant_positions.append((pos, reference_sequence[pos], seq_record.seq[pos]))
    snps.append((seq_record.id, variant_positions))

# Convert SNP results to a DataFrame for better usability
snp_data = []
for seq_id, variants in snps:
    for pos, ref, alt in variants:
        snp_data.append({'Sequence ID': seq_id, 'Position': pos, 'Reference': ref, 'Variant': alt})

snp_df = pd.DataFrame(snp_data)

# Display SNP results
print(snp_df)
```

### Step 3: Filter significant variants

Now we can filter the SNPs based on a hypothetical threshold such as frequency or biological relevance.

```python
# Hypothetical criteria for significant SNPs can be added here
# For the example, we will consider any SNP as significant

significant_snps = snp_df  # Modify this with filtering criteria if needed

# Save the significant SNPs to a CSV file
significant_snps.to_csv('significant_snps.csv', index=False)
print("Significant SNPs saved to significant_snps.csv.")
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial provided a foundational method for analyzing genomic sequences in Python using `Biopython` and `pandas`. You can expand upon this framework by incorporating additional biological databases or advanced statistical analyses to highlight variants associated with specific genetic conditions.
