# Question
How can we use Python to perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics using the Biopython library?

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Biopython
Make sure you have Biopython installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Required Modules
We will need to import the necessary modules from Biopython.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment
```

### Step 3: Load Sequences
Assuming you have two DNA sequences in FASTA format, you can read them as follows:

```python
# Load sequences from FASTA files
seq1 = SeqIO.read("sequence1.fasta", "fasta")
seq2 = SeqIO.read("sequence2.fasta", "fasta")

# Extract sequences
sequence_a = str(seq1.seq)
sequence_b = str(seq2.seq)
```

### Step 4: Perform Sequence Alignment
We will use the pairwise alignment function to align the sequences.

```python
# Perform global sequence alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(sequence_a, sequence_b)

# Print the best alignment
print(format_alignment(*alignments[0]))
```

### Example Sequences
For the sake of demonstration, here are example sequences you can use in your "sequence1.fasta" and "sequence2.fasta":

**sequence1.fasta**
```
>sequence1
ACGTGTA
```

**sequence2.fasta**
```
>sequence2
ACGTCGTA
```

### Step 5: Run the Script
Save your script as `sequence_alignment.py` and run it:

```bash
python sequence_alignment.py
```

### Output
The expected output will display the aligned sequences with gaps if necessary, along with an alignment score. The output might look similar to:

```
ACGT-GTA
ACGTCGTA
  || |||
```

### Conclusion
This tutorial provides a basic approach to perform sequence alignment using Python and Biopython. You can extend this by exploring more advanced alignment algorithms and metrics available in the library.
