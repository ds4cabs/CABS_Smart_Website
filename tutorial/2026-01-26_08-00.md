# Question: How can we use Python to perform a basic analysis of genomic sequences for identifying potential mutations?

## Solution:

In this tutorial, we will analyze a genomic sequence to identify potential mutations compared to a reference sequence using Python. We will utilize the `Biopython` library for sequence manipulation and analysis. Here's how you can do it:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the Biopython library. If not, you can install Biopython using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 1: Import required libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
```

### Step 2: Load reference and query genomic sequences

Assume you have two files: `reference_sequence.fasta` and `query_sequence.fasta`. The FASTA files should be in the following format:

**reference_sequence.fasta**

```
>ref_seq
ATGCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTACGTA
```

**query_sequence.fasta**

```
>query_seq
ATGCGTAGCTTGTCTAGCTACGGA
```

You can load the sequences as follows:

```python
def load_sequence(file_path):
    return SeqIO.read(file_path, "fasta").seq

reference_seq = load_sequence("reference_sequence.fasta")
query_seq = load_sequence("query_sequence.fasta")
```

### Step 3: Identify mutations

To find potential mutations, we can compare the reference sequence with the query sequence. We will create a function to identify positions where the two sequences differ.

```python
def identify_mutations(ref_seq, qry_seq):
    mutations = []
    for index, (ref_base, qry_base) in enumerate(zip(ref_seq, qry_seq)):
        if ref_base != qry_base:
            mutations.append((index + 1, ref_base, qry_base))  # +1 for 1-based index
    return mutations

mutations = identify_mutations(reference_seq, query_seq)
```

### Step 4: Output the results

Finally, we can print the positions and types of the identified mutations.

```python
if mutations:
    print("Identified Mutations (Position, Reference Base, Query Base):")
    for position, ref_base, qry_base in mutations:
        print(f"Position: {position}, Reference Base: {ref_base}, Query Base: {qry_base}")
else:
    print("No mutations identified.")
```

### Complete Code

Here’s the complete code for easy reference:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq

def load_sequence(file_path):
    return SeqIO.read(file_path, "fasta").seq

def identify_mutations(ref_seq, qry_seq):
    mutations = []
    for index, (ref_base, qry_base) in enumerate(zip(ref_seq, qry_seq)):
        if ref_base != qry_base:
            mutations.append((index + 1, ref_base, qry_base))  # +1 for 1-based index
    return mutations

reference_seq = load_sequence("reference_sequence.fasta")
query_seq = load_sequence("query_sequence.fasta")

mutations = identify_mutations(reference_seq, query_seq)

if mutations:
    print("Identified Mutations (Position, Reference Base, Query Base):")
    for position, ref_base, qry_base in mutations:
        print(f"Position: {position}, Reference Base: {ref_base}, Query Base: {qry_base}")
else:
    print("No mutations identified.")
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial outlined a basic approach to comparing genomic sequences for identifying mutations using Python and Biopython. This is a foundational step in bioinformatics and can be expanded with more sophisticated analysis techniques as needed.
