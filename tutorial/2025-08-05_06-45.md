# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and visualize mutations in bioinformatics?

## Solution:

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to analyze genomic sequences using Python and visualize mutations with the `Biopython` and `matplotlib` libraries. Weâ€™ll process a hypothetical genomic sequence, identify mutations compared to a reference sequence, and plot the mutation locations.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install biopython matplotlib
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Load Reference and Sample Sequences

Create two FASTA files:
- `reference.fasta` - This is the reference sequence.
- `sample.fasta` - This is the genomic sequence of the sample.

```python
# Load sequences
reference_seq = SeqIO.read("reference.fasta", "fasta").seq
sample_seq = SeqIO.read("sample.fasta", "fasta").seq
```

### Step 3: Identify Mutations

We will compare the reference with the sample and identify the positions of mutations.

```python
def identify_mutations(reference, sample):
    mutations = []
    
    for i in range(len(reference)):
        if reference[i] != sample[i]:
            mutations.append(i)
    
    return mutations

mutations = identify_mutations(reference_seq, sample_seq)
```

### Step 4: Visualize Mutations

Next, we'll visualize the mutations using `matplotlib`.

```python
def plot_mutations(mutations, sequence_length):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 2))
    plt.scatter(mutations, np.zeros(len(mutations)), color='red', label='Mutations')
    plt.title('Mutation Locations in Genomic Sequence')
    plt.xlabel('Position in Sequence')
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.xlim(0, sequence_length)
    plt.axhline(0, color='black', lw=0.5)
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

plot_mutations(mutations, len(reference_seq))
```

### Step 5: Conclusion

This code provides a framework for identifying and visualizing genomic mutations. You can expand this by incorporating additional features like annotations, different mutation types, or processing multiple samples. 

You can replace the reference and sample sequences with your own data to analyze real genomic information.
