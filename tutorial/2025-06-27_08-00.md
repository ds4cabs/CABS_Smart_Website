# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for identifying DNA mutations that may lead to diseases using advanced AI techniques?

# Solution
In this tutorial, we will utilize Python libraries such as Biopython for genomic data manipulation and TensorFlow/Keras for building a neural network to predict disease-related mutations.

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install biopython tensorflow pandas numpy
```

## Step 2: Load and Prepare the Data
For demonstration purposes, we assume we have a dataset containing genomic sequences and their corresponding labels (1 for mutation, 0 for normal).

```python
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO

# Load genomic sequences from a fasta file
def load_genome_data(fasta_file):
    sequences = []
    labels = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))  # Convert to string
        labels.append(record.description.split('|')[-1])  # Extract label from description
    return sequences, labels

fasta_file = 'genomic_sequences.fasta'
sequences, labels = load_genome_data(fasta_file)

# Encode labels (1 for mutations, 0 for normal)
label_mapping = { 'mutation': 1, 'normal': 0 }
encoded_labels = [label_mapping[label] for label in labels]
```

## Step 3: Data Preprocessing
We need to convert genomic sequences to a format suitable for machine learning.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Tokenize sequences
tokenizer = Tokenizer(char_level=True)  # Character-level tokenization
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sequences)
sequences_encoded = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sequences)

# Pad sequences to ensure uniform length
max_length = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences_encoded)
sequences_padded = pad_sequences(sequences_encoded, maxlen=max_length)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sequences_padded, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 4: Build the Neural Network Model
We will create a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) model.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1, output_dim=128, input_length=max_length))
model.add(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True))
model.add(LSTM(32))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))  # Binary classification

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## Step 5: Train the Model
Train the model using the training dataset.

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

## Step 6: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

```python
# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```

## Step 7: Make Predictions
Make predictions to identify potential mutations.

```python
# Making predictions on new sequences
new_sequences = ["ATGCGTACGTAGCTAG", "GTACGTAGTGAGCTAG"]
new_sequences_encoded = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(new_sequences)
new_sequences_padded = pad_sequences(new_sequences_encoded, maxlen=max_length)

predictions = model.predict(new_sequences_padded)
pred_labels = [1 if pred >= 0.5 else 0 for pred in predictions]
print(f'Predicted labels: {pred_labels}')  # 1 for mutation, 0 for normal
```

## Conclusion
With the above code, we have created a simple AI model to analyze genomic sequences for identifying mutations that could be associated with diseases. This method demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in bioinformatics using Python.
