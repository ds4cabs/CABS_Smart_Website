# Question: How can we use Python for analyzing genomic sequences with AI techniques to predict gene functions?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python to analyze genomic sequences and employ machine learning to predict gene functions using a simple dataset. Weâ€™ll leverage the `scikit-learn` library for the AI component.

### Step 1: Setup

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Load the Dataset

Assume we have a dataset `gene_sequences.fasta` that contains gene sequences and their associated functions.

```python
# Load sequences
gene_data = []
for record in SeqIO.parse("gene_sequences.fasta", "fasta"):
    gene_data.append({"sequence": str(record.seq), "function": record.id})

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(gene_data)
print(df.head())
```

### Step 4: Feature Extraction

We will convert sequences into numerical features (k-mer frequency).

```python
def kmer_frequency(sequence, k=3):
    return {sequence[i:i+k]: sequence.count(sequence[i:i+k]) for i in range(len(sequence) - k + 1)}

# Example of feature extraction
features = df['sequence'].apply(lambda x: kmer_frequency(x))
features_df = pd.DataFrame(list(features)).fillna(0)
```

### Step 5: Prepare Data for Machine Learning

Combine features with labels and split the dataset.

```python
X = features_df
y = df['function']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 6: Train the Model

Using a Random Forest Classifier for gene function prediction.

```python
# Initialize the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model

```python
# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Conclusion

Using the code above, we have built a simple AI model that predicts gene functions based on genomic sequences. You can expand upon this by optimizing the model, using different algorithms, or integrating additional features.
