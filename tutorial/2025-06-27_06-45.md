# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences with deep learning for mutation detection?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will utilize Python, specifically the TensorFlow and Biopython libraries, to build a deep learning model that can analyze genomic sequences and detect mutations. Mutation detection is crucial for understanding genetic variations that can lead to diseases.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Install the following libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow biopython numpy pandas
  ```

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
```

### Step 2: Load and Preprocess Genomic Data

We'll use a FASTA file containing genomic sequences. For this example, let's assume we have a file named `genomic_sequences.fasta`.

```python
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
    return sequences

file_path = 'genomic_sequences.fasta'
sequences = load_sequences(file_path)

# Label sequences (1: mutation, 0: no mutation)
# Here it's assumed you have a way to label your sequences
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=len(sequences))  # Placeholder for actual labels

# Encode sequences (A->0, C->1, G->2, T->3)
def encode_sequence(seq):
    mapping = {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3}
    return np.array([mapping[nuc] for nuc in seq])

encoded_sequences = np.array([encode_sequence(seq) for seq in sequences])
```

### Step 3: Train-Test Split

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(encoded_sequences, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 4: Build the Deep Learning Model

```python
def create_model(input_shape):
    model = keras.Sequential([
        layers.Input(shape=input_shape),
        layers.Embedding(input_dim=4, output_dim=64),
        layers.LSTM(100),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

model = create_model((X_train.shape[1],))
```

### Step 5: Train the Model

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```

### Step 7: Using the Model for Predictions

```python
def predict_mutations(model, sequences):
    encoded_seqs = np.array([encode_sequence(seq) for seq in sequences])
    predictions = model.predict(encoded_seqs)
    return predictions > 0.5

# Example usage
new_sequences = ['ACGTACGT', 'TTGGCCAAT']  # Replace with actual sequences
predictions = predict_mutations(model, new_sequences)
print(predictions)
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial provides a basic framework for using deep learning to analyze genomic sequences for mutation detection. For a more robust application, consider implementing additional preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and using a more extensive and varied dataset.
