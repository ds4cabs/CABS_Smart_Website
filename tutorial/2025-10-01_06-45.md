## Question
How can we use Python to perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics using the Biopython library?

## Solution

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have Biopython installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries
```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Align import PairwiseAligner
```

### Step 2: Load Sequences
Assume you have two FASTA files `sequence1.fasta` and `sequence2.fasta`. Load the sequences from these files.

```python
# Load sequences
def load_sequences(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as file:
        return list(SeqIO.parse(file, "fasta"))

seq1 = load_sequences("sequence1.fasta")[0]  # First sequence from file
seq2 = load_sequences("sequence2.fasta")[0]  # First sequence from file
```

### Step 3: Initialize Pairwise Aligning
Create an instance of `PairwiseAligner` and set the alignment parameters.

```python
aligner = PairwiseAligner()
aligner.mode = "global"  # Set to 'global' for end-to-end alignment
aligner.match_score = 1   # Score for matches
aligner.mismatch_score = -1  # Score for mismatches
aligner.open_gap_score = -2  # Gap opening penalty
aligner.extend_gap_score = -1  # Gap extension penalty
```

### Step 4: Perform Alignment
Align the two sequences.

```python
alignment = aligner.align(seq1.seq, seq2.seq)
```

### Step 5: Display Results
Print the alignment results.

```python
print("Alignment Score: ", alignment.score)  # Print alignment score
for aln in alignment:
    print(aln)  # Print the alignment itself
```

### Complete Code
Hereâ€™s the complete code for easy reference:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Align import PairwiseAligner

# Load sequences
def load_sequences(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as file:
        return list(SeqIO.parse(file, "fasta"))

seq1 = load_sequences("sequence1.fasta")[0]
seq2 = load_sequences("sequence2.fasta")[0]

# Initialize PairwiseAligner
aligner = PairwiseAligner()
aligner.mode = "global"
aligner.match_score = 1
aligner.mismatch_score = -1
aligner.open_gap_score = -2
aligner.extend_gap_score = -1

# Perform alignment
alignment = aligner.align(seq1.seq, seq2.seq)

# Display results
print("Alignment Score: ", alignment.score)
for aln in alignment:
    print(aln)
```

### Conclusion
This code snippet illustrates how to perform sequence alignment using Biopython in Python. You can modify scoring parameters for better results based on your specific requirements.
