# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic data using advanced AI techniques, such as a neural network for predicting gene expressions?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will build a simple neural network using Python and Keras to predict gene expressions from genomic features.

## Prerequisites
- Install necessary packages:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn
  ```

## Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
```

## Step 2: Load the Dataset
Assume we have a dataset `gene_expression.csv` with features derived from genomic data.
```python
# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

## Step 3: Preprocess the Data
```python
# Separating features and target variable
X = data.drop(columns='gene_expression')
y = data['gene_expression']

# Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

## Step 4: Build the Neural Network
```python
# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))  # For regression output

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
```

## Step 5: Train the Model
```python
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

## Step 6: Evaluate the Model
```python
# Evaluate the model on test set
loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {loss}')
```

## Step 7: Make Predictions
```python
# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Display predictions
print(predictions[:5])
```

## Conclusion
This tutorial demonstrated how to use a neural network to predict gene expressions from genomic data. You can refine this model by tuning hyperparameters, adding dropout layers, or using different activation functions based on your specific dataset.
