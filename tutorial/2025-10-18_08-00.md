# Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Predicting Protein Structure Using Deep Learning

## Question
How can we use deep learning to predict the secondary structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences using Python?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will build a simple neural network model using Keras to predict protein secondary structures based on their sequences. We'll utilize one-hot encoding for the amino acids and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential data processing.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras
```

### Step 2: Prepare the Dataset
We'll use the CB513 dataset (protein sequences and their corresponding secondary structures).

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset here (CSV format expected)
# Make sure to have 'sequence' and 'structure' columns
data = pd.read_csv('cb513.csv')

# Example structure of data
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Encode the Sequences
We need to convert the amino acid sequences into a one-hot encoded format.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Define a function to encode sequences
def one_hot_encode_sequences(sequences):
    amino_acids = 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'
    onehot_encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, categories='auto')
    onehot_encoder.fit(np.array(list(amino_acids)).reshape(-1, 1))
  
    # One-hot encode the sequences
    X = []
    for seq in sequences:
        encoded = onehot_encoder.transform(np.array(list(seq)).reshape(-1, 1))
        X.append(encoded)
    return np.array(X)

# One-hot encode the sequences
X = one_hot_encode_sequences(data['sequence'].values)
Y = pd.get_dummies(data['structure']).values
```

### Step 4: Build the LSTM Model

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout, TimeDistributed

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(None, 20)))  # 20 for one-hot encoding
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(3, activation='softmax')))  # Assuming 3 classes (e.g., helix, sheet, coil)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Step 5: Train the Model

```python
# Reshape data to fit LSTM [samples, time steps, features]
X_reshaped = np.array([seq for seq in X])
Y_reshaped = Y.reshape(Y.shape[0], -1, Y.shape[1]//len(data['sequence'].iloc[0]))

# Train the model
model.fit(X_reshaped, Y_reshaped, batch_size=32, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)
```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_reshaped, Y_reshaped)
print(f'Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

### Step 7: Make Predictions

```python
# Prediction on new data
def predict_structure(sequence):
    encoded_seq = one_hot_encode_sequences([sequence])
    prediction = model.predict(encoded_seq)
    return np.argmax(prediction, axis=-1)

# Example usage:
predicted_structure = predict_structure("ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY")
print(predicted_structure)
```

### Conclusion
We have successfully built an LSTM-based neural network model to predict protein secondary structures from sequences using Python and Keras. You can further refine this model by tuning hyperparameters and using larger datasets for improved accuracy.
