# Question
How can we use Python to analyze DNA sequences and identify potential gene mutations that could be linked to diseases?

# Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
To analyze DNA sequences, we will use the following Python libraries: Biopython for biological computation and Pandas for data manipulation. Ensure that you have them installed:

```bash
pip install biopython pandas
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
import pandas as pd
```

### Step 3: Load DNA Data
Assume you have a FASTA file (`sequences.fasta`) that contains DNA sequences.

```python
# Load sequences from FASTA file
sequences = []
for record in SeqIO.parse("sequences.fasta", "fasta"):
    sequences.append({"id": record.id, "sequence": str(record.seq)})
```

### Step 4: Define a Function to Find Mutations
We can define a function to identify the mutations in a given DNA sequence by comparing it to a reference sequence.

```python
def find_mutations(reference, sequence):
    mutations = []
    for i, (ref_base, test_base) in enumerate(zip(reference, sequence)):
        if ref_base != test_base:
            mutations.append((i + 1, ref_base, test_base))  # 1-based index
    return mutations
```

### Step 5: Analyze Sequences
Assuming we have a reference DNA sequence for comparison, we will analyze each sequence.

```python
# Reference sequence (example)
reference_sequence = "AGCTTAGCTAAGCTAGCTAGCTAGC"

# Store results
mutation_results = []

for seq in sequences:
    mutations = find_mutations(reference_sequence, seq["sequence"])
    mutation_results.append({"id": seq["id"], "mutations": mutations})
```

### Step 6: Convert Results to DataFrame
We can convert the results into a Pandas DataFrame for easier analysis and export.

```python
# Create DataFrame
results_df = pd.DataFrame(mutation_results)

# Expand mutations into separate columns for better readability
results_df["mutation_details"] = results_df["mutations"].apply(lambda x: ', '.join([f"Position: {m[0]}, From: {m[1]}, To: {m[2]}" for m in x]))

# Show the DataFrame
print(results_df[["id", "mutation_details"]])
```

### Step 7: Save Results
Finally, we can save the results to a CSV file for further investigation.

```python
results_df.to_csv("mutation_results.csv", index=False)
```

### Conclusion
This tutorial demonstrated how to identify gene mutations in DNA sequences using Python. The analysis can be expanded with more complex algorithms and larger datasets to support advanced bioinformatic studies.
