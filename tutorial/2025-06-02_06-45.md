# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for identifying potential gene mutations?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python to analyze DNA sequences and identify potential mutations that could indicate genetic disorders. We'll utilize the Biopython library, which provides tools for biological computation.

### Step 1: Install Biopython

First, ensure that you have Biopython installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Required Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
```

### Step 3: Load DNA Sequence

For this example, let's assume you have a FASTA file containing DNA sequences. We will read the sequence from the file.

```python
# Load the genomic sequence from a FASTA file
def load_sequence(file_path):
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        return record.seq

dna_sequence = load_sequence("genomic_sequence.fasta")
print(f"Loaded DNA Sequence: {dna_sequence}")
```

### Step 4: Identify Mutations

Next, we will define a function to identify mutations by comparing the DNA sequence with a reference sequence.

```python
def identify_mutations(sequence, reference):
    mutations = []
    
    for i in range(len(sequence)):
        if sequence[i] != reference[i]:
            mutations.append((i, reference[i], sequence[i]))
    
    return mutations

# Example reference sequence
reference_sequence = Seq("ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTGACTGACGTA")

# Identify mutations
mutations = identify_mutations(dna_sequence, reference_sequence)
print("Identified Mutations (Position, Reference Base, Mutated Base):")
for mutation in mutations:
    print(mutation)
```

### Step 5: Calculate GC Content

Finally, we will calculate the GC content of the DNA sequence, which is important for understanding the stability of the DNA molecule.

```python
gc_content = GC(dna_sequence)
print(f"GC Content: {gc_content:.2f}%")
```

### Full Code

Hereâ€™s the complete code bundled together:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC

def load_sequence(file_path):
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        return record.seq

def identify_mutations(sequence, reference):
    mutations = []
    
    for i in range(len(sequence)):
        if sequence[i] != reference[i]:
            mutations.append((i, reference[i], sequence[i]))
    
    return mutations

# Load DNA sequence
dna_sequence = load_sequence("genomic_sequence.fasta")
print(f"Loaded DNA Sequence: {dna_sequence}")

# Example reference sequence
reference_sequence = Seq("ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTGACTGACGTA")

# Identify mutations
mutations = identify_mutations(dna_sequence, reference_sequence)
print("Identified Mutations (Position, Reference Base, Mutated Base):")
for mutation in mutations:
    print(mutation)

# Calculate GC content
gc_content = GC(dna_sequence)
print(f"GC Content: {gc_content:.2f}%")
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Python with Biopython to analyze genomic sequences for identifying mutations and calculating GC content. This can serve as a foundational step for more advanced bioinformatics analyses.
