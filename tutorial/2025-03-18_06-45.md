# Question

How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and predict gene functions using machine learning techniques in bioinformatics?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will utilize Python for genomic sequence analysis and gene function prediction using machine learning. We'll use libraries such as Biopython for sequence handling, and scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install biopython scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Step 2: Load Genomic Data

First, we will load genomic sequences from a FASTA file.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

def load_genomic_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
    return sequences

genomic_sequences = load_genomic_sequences("genome.fasta")
print(genomic_sequences[:5])  # Display first 5 sequences
```

## Step 3: Feature Extraction

Next, we'll extract features from the sequences, such as k-mer counts. 

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

def extract_kmer_features(sequences, k):
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(analyzer='char', ngram_range=(k, k))
    kmer_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(sequences)
    return kmer_features, vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

k = 3  # Example for trigrams
kmer_features, feature_names = extract_kmer_features(genomic_sequences, k)
print(f"K-mer features shape: {kmer_features.shape}")
```

## Step 4: Prepare Labels for Gene Functions

We'll create a dataset with labels (gene functions). This is usually obtained from biological databases, but for this example, let's create a mock dataset.

```python
import numpy as np

# Mock dataset for demonstration (0 = function A, 1 = function B)
labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=len(genomic_sequences))
```

## Step 5: Split Data for Training and Testing

We will split our data into training and testing sets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(kmer_features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
print(f"Training set shape: {X_train.shape}, Test set shape: {X_test.shape}")
```

## Step 6: Train a Machine Learning Model

Now we'll train a model using a Random Forest Classifier.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

## Step 7: Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've demonstrated how to analyze genomic sequences and predict gene functions using machine learning techniques in Python. The process involves loading genomic data, extracting features, preparing labels, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.
