# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic data for that includes identifying locations of gene variants and performing basic statistical analysis?

# Solution

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load genomic data
# Assuming we have a CSV file containing genomic variants with columns: 'Gene', 'Variant', 'Type', and 'Frequency'
data = pd.read_csv('genomic_variants.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())

# Basic Data Exploration
print(data.info())
print(data.describe())

# Count of variants by type
variant_counts = data['Type'].value_counts()
print(variant_counts)

# Visualization of variant types
sns.barplot(x=variant_counts.index, y=variant_counts.values)
plt.title('Count of Variants by Type')
plt.xlabel('Variant Type')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()

# Identifying high-frequency variants
high_freq_variants = data[data['Frequency'] > 0.1]
print("High-Frequency Variants:\n", high_freq_variants)

# Perform statistical analysis (e.g., t-test on frequencies of two types of variants)
from scipy import stats

# Assuming we have two types of variants, 'SNP' and 'INDEL'
snp_frequencies = data[data['Type'] == 'SNP']['Frequency']
indel_frequencies = data[data['Type'] == 'INDEL']['Frequency']

t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(snp_frequencies, indel_frequencies, equal_var=False)

print("T-statistic:", t_stat)
print("P-value:", p_value)

# Conclusion
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("There is a statistically significant difference between the frequencies of SNPs and INDELs.")
else:
    print("No statistically significant difference between the frequencies.")
```

### Explanation

1. **Data Loading**: Loads genomic data from a CSV file.
2. **Exploration**: Displays basic information and statistics about the dataset.
3. **Variant Counting**: Counts occurrences of various variant types.
4. **Visualization**: Creates a bar plot for visual representation of variant counts.
5. **Filter High-Frequency Variants**: Identifies variants with a frequency greater than 10%.
6. **Statistical Analysis**: Conducts a t-test to compare the frequencies of SNP and INDEL variants.
7. **Conclusion**: Indicates whether the difference in frequencies is statistically significant.
