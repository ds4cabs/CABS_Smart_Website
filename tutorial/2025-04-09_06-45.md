# Tutorial: Predicting Protein Secondary Structure Using Machine Learning

## Question
How can we predict the secondary structure of proteins using machine learning techniques in Python?

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Load Dataset
Assuming we have a dataset in FASTA format containing protein sequences and their secondary structures.
```python
def parse_fasta(file_path):
    sequences = []
    structures = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
        structures.append(record.description.split()[1])  # Assuming structure is the second word
    return sequences, structures

sequences, structures = parse_fasta("proteins.fasta")
```

### Step 4: Feature Extraction
Extracting features using the simplistic approach of character counts.
```python
def extract_features(sequences):
    features = []
    for seq in sequences:
        count = [seq.count(aa) for aa in 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY']
        features.append(count)
    return pd.DataFrame(features)

features = extract_features(sequences)
```

### Step 5: Data Preparation
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
```python
X = features
y = structures

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 6: Train the Model
Using Random Forest Classifier.
```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 7: Predictions and Evaluation
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Complete Code
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from Bio import SeqIO

def parse_fasta(file_path):
    sequences = []
    structures = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
        structures.append(record.description.split()[1])
    return sequences, structures

def extract_features(sequences):
    features = []
    for seq in sequences:
        count = [seq.count(aa) for aa in 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY']
        features.append(count)
    return pd.DataFrame(features)

sequences, structures = parse_fasta("proteins.fasta")
features = extract_features(sequences)
X = features
y = structures

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
