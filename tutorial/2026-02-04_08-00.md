# Tutorial: Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions using Python

## Question
How can we predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using machine learning in bioinformatics?

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Load Protein Interaction Data
```python
# Load dataset from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('protein_interactions.csv')

# Display first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
```

### Step 4: Feature Selection and Data Preprocessing
```python
# Selecting features and target variable
X = data.drop(['interaction'], axis=1)  # features
y = data['interaction']                   # target variable

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Train the Model
```python
# Initialize Random Forest Classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Make Predictions
```python
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model
```python
# Compute the accuracy and classification report
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print('Classification Report:')
print(report)
```

### Step 8: Save the Model (Optional)
```python
import joblib

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'ppi_model.pkl')
```

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can build a machine learning model to predict protein-protein interactions in Python. Adjust the features and model parameters as needed for better accuracy.
