# How can we use Python for advanced AI in bioinformatics?

In this tutorial, we will explore how to apply advanced AI techniques using Python for gene expression analysis. We will implement a simple neural network to classify samples based on their gene expression profiles.

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Dataset

For this tutorial, we will use a hypothetical gene expression dataset. The dataset consists of features representing gene expression levels and a label indicating the condition (e.g., cancer or non-cancer).

### Code Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Load the dataset
# Assume we have a CSV file 'gene_expression.csv' with features and labels
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv')

# Preprocess the data
X = data.drop('label', axis=1).values  # Features
y = data['label'].values  # Labels

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the feature values
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Build the neural network model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # For binary classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predictions = (predictions > 0.5).astype(int)  # Convert probabilities to binary output
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we successfully built and trained a neural network to classify gene expression data using Python. This method can be further enhanced by incorporating deeper architectures, regularization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
