# Question
How can we utilize Python to analyze DNA sequences and implement a basic machine learning model to predict gene functions based on sequence patterns?

# Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython pandas scikit-learn
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
```

### Step 3: Load and Parse DNA Sequences

Assuming you have a FASTA file (`genes.fasta`) containing DNA sequences.

```python
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

dna_sequences = load_sequences('genes.fasta')
```

### Step 4: Feature Extraction

Transform DNA sequences into numerical features (e.g., k-mer frequency).

```python
def kmer_frequency(seq, k):
    return {seq[i:i+k]: seq.count(seq[i:i+k]) for i in range(len(seq) - k + 1)}

k = 3  # Using 3-mers
features = {id_: kmer_frequency(seq, k) for id_, seq in dna_sequences.items()}
features_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(features, orient='index').fillna(0)
```

### Step 5: Prepare Labels

Assuming you have a CSV file (`gene_functions.csv`) that contains gene IDs and their corresponding functions.

```python
labels_df = pd.read_csv('gene_functions.csv')
labels_df.set_index('gene_id', inplace=True)

# Merge features with labels
data = features_df.join(labels_df, how='inner')
X = data.drop(columns='function')
y = data['function']
```

### Step 6: Train-Test Split

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 7: Training the Model

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 8: Making Predictions

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 9: Evaluate the Model

```python
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to process DNA sequences using Python and classifies gene functions using a machine learning model. Explore adjusting k-mer sizes and using different classifiers for improved accuracy.
