# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for detecting patterns linked to genetic diseases?

## Solution: Analyzing Genomic Sequences using Python

In this tutorial, we will utilize Python libraries to analyze genomic sequences to identify patterns that may be linked to genetic diseases. We will use Biopython for handling biological data.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install biopython numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Step 2: Load Genomic Data

Assume we have a FASTA file named `genes.fasta` containing genomic sequences.

```python
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

sequences = load_sequences("genes.fasta")
```

### Step 3: Analyze Nucleotide Composition

We will define a function to analyze the nucleotide composition of these sequences.

```python
def nucleotide_composition(sequence):
    total_length = len(sequence)
    nucleotide_counts = {
        'A': sequence.count('A'),
        'T': sequence.count('T'),
        'C': sequence.count('C'),
        'G': sequence.count('G')
    }
    composition = {nuc: count / total_length for nuc, count in nucleotide_counts.items()}
    return composition

# Analyze a specific sequence (for example, using the first sequence)
first_sequence = next(iter(sequences.values()))
composition = nucleotide_composition(first_sequence)
print("Nucleotide Composition:", composition)
```

### Step 4: Visualize Nucleotide Composition

Let’s create a bar chart to visualize the nucleotide composition.

```python
def plot_nucleotide_composition(composition):
    plt.bar(composition.keys(), composition.values(), color=['red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange'])
    plt.xlabel('Nucleotides')
    plt.ylabel('Proportion')
    plt.title('Nucleotide Composition of Genomic Sequence')
    plt.show()

plot_nucleotide_composition(composition)
```

### Step 5: Identify Patterns Linked to Genetic Diseases

We will create a function to detect common motifs known to be associated with genetic diseases.

```python
def find_motifs(sequences, motif):
    motif_locations = {}
    for seq_id, seq in sequences.items():
        locations = []
        start = 0
        while start < len(seq):
            start = seq.find(motif, start)
            if start == -1:
                break
            locations.append(start)
            start += 1
        motif_locations[seq_id] = locations
    return motif_locations

# Example: Search for the motif "ATG" commonly linked to start codons
motif = "ATG"
motif_locations = find_motifs(sequences, motif)
print("Motif Locations:", motif_locations)
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to analyze genomic sequences using Python, including loading sequences, analyzing nucleotide composition, visualizing data, and identifying genetic disease-linked motifs. Adjust the `motif` variable to search for different sequences based on your research needs.

Ensure genomic data is ethically sourced and used according to applicable regulations.
