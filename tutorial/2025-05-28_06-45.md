# Question
How can we use Python with BioPython to analyze DNA sequences and identify gene features?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will explore how to analyze DNA sequences using the BioPython library. We will load a DNA sequence, calculate its GC content, and identify gene features.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have BioPython installed. If you haven't installed it yet, use the following command:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Step 1: Load the DNA Sequence

First, we need to load a DNA sequence from a file or a string.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

# Load a DNA sequence from a FASTA file
sequence_file = "example_dna.fasta"
record = SeqIO.read(sequence_file, "fasta")

# Display the DNA sequence
print("ID:", record.id)
print("Description:", record.description)
print("Sequence:", record.seq)
```

## Step 2: Calculate GC Content

Now, we will calculate the GC content of the loaded DNA sequence. GC content is an important feature in bioinformatics.

```python
def gc_content(dna_sequence):
    g_count = dna_sequence.count("G")
    c_count = dna_sequence.count("C")
    total_length = len(dna_sequence)
    return (g_count + c_count) / total_length * 100

# Calculate and display the GC content
gc_percentage = gc_content(str(record.seq))
print("GC Content: {:.2f}%".format(gc_percentage))
```

## Step 3: Identify Gene Features

Next, we will identify possible gene features such as start and stop codons within the DNA sequence.

```python
def identify_genes(sequence):
    start_codon = "ATG"
    stop_codons = ["TAA", "TAG", "TGA"]
    genes = []
    
    # Scan for start codons
    for i in range(len(sequence) - 2):
        if sequence[i:i+3] == start_codon:
            for j in range(i, len(sequence) - 2, 3):
                if sequence[j:j + 3] in stop_codons:
                    genes.append(sequence[i:j + 3])
                    break
    return genes

# Identify and display gene features
genes = identify_genes(str(record.seq))
print("Identified Genes:", genes)
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, we loaded a DNA sequence, calculated the GC content, and identified gene features using BioPython. This approach can be extended to more complex analyses in bioinformatics, such as gene annotation and comparative genomics.
