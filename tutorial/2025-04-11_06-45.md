# Tutorial: Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions using Python

## Question
How can we predict potential protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using machine learning in bioinformatics?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will build a simple model using Python to predict PPIs based on feature extraction from protein sequences. We will use the `scikit-learn` library for machine learning and `biopython` to handle biological data.

### Prerequisites
- Python (>=3.6)
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `biopython`, `pandas`, `numpy`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn biopython pandas numpy
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 2: Load Protein Sequence Data

Assuming we have a dataset of protein sequences in FASTA format, along with their interaction status (1 for interaction, 0 for no interaction). 

```python
def load_data(fasta_file, interaction_file):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)

    interactions = pd.read_csv(interaction_file)
    return sequences, interactions

fasta_file = 'proteins.fasta'
interaction_file = 'interactions.csv'
sequences, interactions = load_data(fasta_file, interaction_file)
```

### Step 3: Feature Extraction

We will create a basic feature representation by counting amino acid occurrences.

```python
def extract_features(sequences):
    features = []
    for seq in sequences.values():
        feature_vector = [seq.count(amino) for amino in "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"]
        features.append(feature_vector)
    return np.array(features)

X = extract_features(sequences)
```

### Step 4: Prepare Labels

We match the labels from the interaction dataset to our features.

```python
def prepare_labels(interactions, seq_ids):
    labels = []
    for seq_id in seq_ids:
        if seq_id in interactions['protein_id'].values:
            labels.append(interactions[interactions['protein_id'] == seq_id]['interaction'].values[0])
        else:
            labels.append(0)
    return np.array(labels)

Y = prepare_labels(interactions, list(sequences.keys()))
```

### Step 5: Train-Test Split

```python
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 6: Model Training

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```

### Step 7: Model Evaluation

```python
Y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(Y_test, Y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(Y_test, Y_pred))
```

### Conclusion

You have successfully created a basic machine learning model to predict protein-protein interactions using Python. This framework can be enhanced by adding more sophisticated feature extraction techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and using more complex models.
