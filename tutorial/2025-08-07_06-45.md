# How can we predict protein secondary structure using the PSIPRED server with Python?

### Solution

In this tutorial, we will use the PSIPRED web server, which is a tool for predicting protein secondary structure. We will write a Python script to automate the submission of a protein sequence and retrieve the results.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)

### Step 1: Submit the Protein Sequence

Hereâ€™s how to submit a protein sequence to the PSIPRED server:

```python
import requests

def submit_sequence(sequence):
    url = "http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/submission"
    payload = {
        'sequence': sequence,
        'email': 'your_email@domain.com'  # For receiving results
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, data=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Sequence submitted successfully.")
        return response.json()  # Assuming it returns JSON with a job ID
    else:
        print(f"Error submitting sequence: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Example usage
protein_sequence = "MKTAYIAKQRQISFVKSHFGY"  # Example protein sequence
job_info = submit_sequence(protein_sequence)
```

### Step 2: Check the Job Status

After submission, you'll need to check the status of the job:

```python
def check_status(job_id):
    url = f"http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/status/{job_id}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Assuming it returns JSON with the status
    else:
        print(f"Error checking status: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Example usage
if job_info:
    job_id = job_info['job_id']  # Replace with the actual key in response
    status = check_status(job_id)
    print(f"Job Status: {status}")
```

### Step 3: Retrieve Results

Once the job is complete, you can retrieve the results:

```python
def retrieve_results(job_id):
    url = f"http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/results/{job_id}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Results retrieved successfully.")
        return response.text  # Assuming the results are in plain text
    else:
        print(f"Error retrieving results: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Example usage
if status and status['status'] == 'completed':  # Replace with actual completion status
    results = retrieve_results(job_id)
    print(results)
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to automate protein secondary structure prediction using the PSIPRED server with Python. You can now replace the example protein sequence and modify the script according to your needs. Make sure to respect the server's usage policies!
