# Tutorial: Using Python for Genomic Data Analysis with Biopython

## Question
How can we analyze genomic sequences for motif finding using Python and the Biopython library?

## Solution

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and Biopython installed.

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import nt_search
```

### Step 2: Load Genomic Data

Suppose we have a FASTA file named `genome.fasta`.

```python
genome_file = "genome.fasta"
sequences = SeqIO.parse(genome_file, "fasta")
```

### Step 3: Define Motif to Search

Let's define a motif we want to find in our genomic sequences.

```python
motif = "ATGCGT"
```

### Step 4: Search for the Motif

We'll search for the motif in each sequence from the FASTA file.

```python
for seq_record in sequences:
    sequence = str(seq_record.seq)
    locations = nt_search(sequence, motif)
    
    if locations[0] != 0:  # nt_search returns the starting positions
        print(f"Motif found in {seq_record.id} at positions: {locations[1:]}")
    else:
        print(f"Motif not found in {seq_record.id}.")
```

### Step 5: Example FASTA File Content

Consider the following content in `genome.fasta`:

```
>seq1
ATGCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTGATCGATCGATGCGTACGATCG
>seq2
ATGCGTTAGCTAGCTAAGCTGATCGTAGTACGTA
```

### Step 6: Run the Code

When you run the code above, it will output the locations of the specified motif in each sequence:

```
Motif found in seq1 at positions: [11]
Motif found in seq2 at positions: [7]
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial provides a basic yet powerful method for identifying motifs within genomic sequences using Python and Biopython. This is useful in various bioinformatics applications, including gene identification and evolutionary studies.
