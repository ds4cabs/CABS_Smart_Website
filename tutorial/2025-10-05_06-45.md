# Question
How can we implement a machine learning model to predict protein function based on sequence data using Python?

# Solution

## Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
```

## Step 2: Load Data
Assuming we have a CSV file `protein_sequences.csv` with protein sequences and their functions.
```python
data = pd.read_csv('protein_sequences.csv')
print(data.head())
```

## Step 3: Preprocess Data
Convert sequences to features (one-hot encoding or k-mer representation).
We will use k-mer representation for this example.
```python
def kmer_representation(sequence, k=3):
    return [sequence[i:i+k] for i in range(len(sequence) - k + 1)]

data['kmer_features'] = data['sequence'].apply(lambda x: kmer_representation(x, k=3))
data['kmer_features'] = data['kmer_features'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x))
```

## Step 4: Encode Labels
We will encode the function labels into integers.
```python
le = LabelEncoder()
data['encoded_function'] = le.fit_transform(data['function'])
```

## Step 5: Prepare Features and Labels
```python
X = data['kmer_features']
y = data['encoded_function']
```

## Step 6: Train-Test Split
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 7: Feature Extraction from k-mers
Convert k-mer features into a bag-of-words representation.
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
```

## Step 8: Train the Model
```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)
```

## Step 9: Prediction and Evaluation
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=le.classes_))
```

## Conclusion
This tutorial provides a basic framework for predicting protein functions based on sequences using k-mer representation and random forest classifier in Python. Adjust the k-mer size and model parameters for better results.
