# Tutorial: Using Python for Advanced AI in Bioinformatics

## Question
How can we use Python to classify DNA sequences based on their features using a machine learning model?

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can do this via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Load and Prepare Data

We'll use a fictional dataset of DNA sequences stored in FASTA format. Each sequence is associated with a label indicating its class.

```python
def load_data(fasta_file):
    sequences = []
    labels = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
        labels.append(record.annotations['label'])  # assuming labels are in annotations
    return sequences, labels

sequences, labels = load_data("dna_sequences.fasta")
```

### Step 4: Feature Extraction

Convert DNA sequences into features that can be used for model training.

```python
def extract_features(sequences):
    features = []
    for seq in sequences:
        # Example feature: length of the sequence and GC content
        length = len(seq)
        gc_content = (seq.count('G') + seq.count('C')) / length
        features.append([length, gc_content])
    return np.array(features)

X = extract_features(sequences)
y = np.array(labels)
```

### Step 5: Split the Dataset

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 6: Train the Model

Using a Random Forest Classifier for classification.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model

Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to classify DNA sequences using a machine learning model in Python. By extracting features like sequence length and GC content, we can create a predictive model that can help in bioinformatics analysis. Adjust the feature extraction based on the specific requirements of your dataset to improve model performance.
