# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for pattern identification in bioinformatics?

## Solution: Analyzing Genomic Sequences with Python

In this tutorial, we will analyze genomic sequences to identify specific patterns using Python. We will utilize the Biopython library, which provides essential tools for biological computation.

### Prerequisites
- Install Biopython using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install biopython
  ```

### Code Implementation

```python
# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC

# Step 2: Load a genomic sequence file (FASTA format)
def load_sequence(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        for record in SeqIO.parse(file, "fasta"):
            return record

# Step 3: Define a pattern to search for
def find_pattern(sequence, pattern):
    start_positions = []
    start = 0
    while True:
        start = sequence.find(pattern, start)
        if start == -1: break
        start_positions.append(start)
        start += 1  # Move past the last found position
    return start_positions

# Step 4: Analyze the genomic sequence
def analyze_genome(filename, pattern):
    record = load_sequence(filename)
    seq = record.seq

    print(f"Loaded Sequence: {record.id}")
    print(f"GC Content: {GC(seq)}%")
    
    pattern_indices = find_pattern(str(seq), pattern)
    if pattern_indices:
        print(f"Pattern '{pattern}' found at positions: {pattern_indices}")
    else:
        print(f"Pattern '{pattern}' not found in the sequence.")

# Step 5: Execute the analysis
if __name__ == "__main__":
    fasta_file = "example_genome.fasta"
    search_pattern = "ATG"  # Change this to any desired pattern
    analyze_genome(fasta_file, search_pattern)
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Import Libraries**: The code begins by importing modules from Biopython.
2. **Load Sequence**: A function to read a FASTA file and extract the genomic sequence.
3. **Find Pattern**: This function looks for the specified pattern in the sequence and returns the start positions.
4. **Analyze Genome**: This function integrates loading the sequence, calculating GC content, and finding the pattern.
5. **Execution**: Modify the `fasta_file` and `search_pattern` variables to run the analysis on your genomic data.

### Conclusion
This tutorial provided a step-by-step guide to analyze genomic sequences using Python with Biopython. By identifying patterns in sequences, researchers can gain insight into genetic structures and functions.
