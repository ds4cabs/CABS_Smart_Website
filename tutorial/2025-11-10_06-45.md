# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequence data and implement a basic machine-learning model to predict gene functions based on sequence features?

# Solution

## Step 1: Import Libraries
First, we need to import the necessary libraries.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
from Bio import SeqIO
```

## Step 2: Load Genomic Data
Assuming you have a FASTA file of sequences and a CSV file containing gene functions, we will read this data.

```python
# Load sequences from a FASTA file
def load_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

# Load gene function data
def load_gene_functions(csv_file):
    return pd.read_csv(csv_file)

fasta_file = 'sequences.fasta'
csv_file = 'gene_functions.csv'

sequences = load_sequences(fasta_file)
gene_data = load_gene_functions(csv_file)
```

## Step 3: Feature Extraction
We will create a function to extract features from the sequences.

```python
def extract_features(sequences):
    features = []
    for seq_id, sequence in sequences.items():
        length = len(sequence)
        gc_content = (sequence.count('G') + sequence.count('C')) / length
        features.append([length, gc_content, seq_id])
    return pd.DataFrame(features, columns=['Length', 'GC_Content', 'ID'])

features_df = extract_features(sequences)
```

## Step 4: Merge Features with Gene Functions
Now we merge the extracted features with the gene function data.

```python
merged_data = pd.merge(features_df, gene_data, left_on='ID', right_on='Gene_ID')
X = merged_data[['Length', 'GC_Content']]
y = merged_data['Function']
```

## Step 5: Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 6: Train the Model
We will use a Random Forest classifier for this task.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 7: Make Predictions
Now we can use the model to make predictions.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Step 8: Evaluate the Model
We will evaluate the model using classification metrics.

```python
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Summary
This code outlines how to analyze genomic sequences, extract relevant features, and predict gene functions using a machine learning approach in Python. Make sure to adapt file paths and feature extraction methods as needed based on your specific dataset and research goals.
