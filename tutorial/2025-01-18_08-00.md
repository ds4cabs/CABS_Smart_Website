# Question: How can we use Python to perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to perform sequence alignment using the Biopython library, which provides tools for biological computation. We will focus on the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, a classic method for global sequence alignment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the Biopython library. You can install Biopython via pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step-by-Step Code

1. **Import Required Libraries**:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment
```

2. **Define the Sequences**:

```python
# Define two DNA sequences for alignment
seq1 = "AGCTGTA"
seq2 = "AGCTGTAAG"
```

3. **Perform Sequence Alignment**:

```python
# Perform global alignment using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)
```

4. **Display the Best Alignment**:

```python
# Print all alignments
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Full Code Example

Here is the complete example put together:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Define two DNA sequences for alignment
seq1 = "AGCTGTA"
seq2 = "AGCTGTAAG"

# Perform global alignment using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)

# Print all alignments
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Explanation of Output

The output will show the aligned sequences along with the alignment score, which indicates how well the sequences match. The alignment will highlight matches, mismatches, and gaps.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we showcased how to use Python's Biopython library to perform sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This technique is vital in bioinformatics for comparing biological sequences and understanding their relationships.
