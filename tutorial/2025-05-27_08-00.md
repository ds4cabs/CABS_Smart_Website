# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genetic sequence data and identify potential mutations associated with a specific disease?

# Solution

### Prerequisites
You will need the following libraries:
- Biopython
- pandas
- numpy

You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython pandas numpy
```

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
```

### Step 2: Load and Parse Genetic Data

Assuming we have a FASTA file containing genetic sequences.

```python
# Load genetic sequences from a FASTA file
def load_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

sequences = load_sequences("genetic_sequences.fasta")
```

### Step 3: Calculate GC Content

The GC content can help identify the stability and potential mutations in DNA sequences.

```python
def calculate_gc_content(sequences):
    gc_content = {}
    for seq_id, sequence in sequences.items():
        gc_content[seq_id] = GC(sequence)
    return gc_content

gc_contents = calculate_gc_content(sequences)
print(pd.Series(gc_contents))
```

### Step 4: Identify Variants

Let's say we want to identify mutations by comparing a reference sequence with other sequences.

```python
def identify_mutations(reference_seq, target_seq):
    mutations = []
    for ref, target in zip(reference_seq, target_seq):
        if ref != target:
            mutations.append((ref, target))
    return mutations

# Assume the first sequence is the reference
reference_sequence = sequences[list(sequences.keys())[0]]

# Identify mutations for other sequences
mutations_results = {}
for seq_id, sequence in sequences.items():
    if seq_id != list(sequences.keys())[0]:
        mutations_results[seq_id] = identify_mutations(reference_sequence, sequence)

# Display mutation results
for seq_id, mutations in mutations_results.items():
    print(f"Mutations in {seq_id}: {mutations}")
```

### Step 5: Analyze Results

You can present results in a structured format.

```python
def analyze_mutations(mutations_results):
    mutation_summary = []
    for seq_id, mutations in mutations_results.items():
        mutation_summary.append({"Sequence ID": seq_id, "Number of Mutations": len(mutations), "Mutations": mutations})
    return pd.DataFrame(mutation_summary)

mutation_summary_df = analyze_mutations(mutations_results)
print(mutation_summary_df)
```

### Conclusion

This script provides a fundamental approach to load genetic sequences, compute GC content, and identify mutations. With such methodologies, bioinformatics researchers can analyze genomic data to pinpoint variations associated with diseases.
