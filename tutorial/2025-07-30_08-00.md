# Question: How can we analyze genomic sequences using Python and machine learning for bioinformatics applications?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will explore how to analyze genomic sequences using Python, with a focus on machine learning techniques that can help in classification tasks such as predicting gene functions.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `biopython`
  
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn biopython
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
```

### Step 2: Load Genomic Data

For this example, let's assume we have a FASTA file containing sequences and their respective labels in a CSV file.

```python
# Load sequences from a FASTA file
def load_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

sequences = load_sequences('sequences.fasta')

# Load labels from a CSV file
labels = pd.read_csv('labels.csv', index_col=0)
```

### Step 3: Feature Extraction

Extract features from the sequences. For simplicity, we'll use the length of sequences and the frequency of nucleotides.

```python
def extract_features(sequences):
    features = []
    for seq in sequences.values():
        length = len(seq)
        a_count = seq.count('A')
        t_count = seq.count('T')
        g_count = seq.count('G')
        c_count = seq.count('C')
        features.append([length, a_count, t_count, g_count, c_count])
    return np.array(features)

X = extract_features(sequences)
y = labels['label'].values
```

### Step 4: Train-Test Split

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Train a Machine Learning Model

We'll use a Random Forest classifier for this task.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to load genomic data, extract features, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance. This workflow is fundamental in bioinformatics for tasks such as gene function prediction and understanding genomic sequences.
