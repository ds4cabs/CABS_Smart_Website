# Question
How can we utilize advanced AI techniques to analyze genomic sequences for identifying potential mutations associated with a specific disease using Python?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python to perform advanced AI analysis on genomic sequences. We will employ a machine learning model to classify sequences based on whether they contain mutations associated with a given disease. For this, we will use the `scikit-learn` library for machine learning.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

To get started, install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Load Data

Assuming we have a FASTA file containing genomic sequences and a CSV file that maps these sequences to labels indicating whether they are associated with a disease (1 for mutation, 0 for no mutation).

```python
# Load the genomic sequences from a FASTA file
def load_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
    return sequences

# Load labels from a CSV file
def load_labels(labels_file):
    labels = pd.read_csv(labels_file)
    return labels

fasta_file = 'genomic_sequences.fasta'
labels_file = 'labels.csv'

sequences = load_sequences(fasta_file)
labels = load_labels(labels_file)
```

### Step 4: Feature Extraction

We will convert DNA sequences (A, T, C, G) into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

```python
def one_hot_encode(sequences):
    # Create a mapping for one-hot encoding
    mapping = {'A': [1, 0, 0, 0], 'C': [0, 1, 0, 0],
               'G': [0, 0, 1, 0], 'T': [0, 0, 0, 1]}
    encoded_sequences = []
    
    for seq in sequences:
        encoded_seq = []
        for nucleotide in seq:
            encoded_seq += mapping.get(nucleotide, [0, 0, 0, 0])
        encoded_sequences.append(encoded_seq)
    
    return np.array(encoded_sequences)

X = one_hot_encode(sequences)
y = labels['mutation'].values
```

### Step 5: Train-Test Split

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 6: Model Training

Train a Random Forest classifier on the training set.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 7: Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model on the test set and print results.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to use advanced AI techniques in bioinformatics for analyzing genomic sequences. We extracted features from DNA sequences, trained a machine learning model, and evaluated its performance in predicting disease-associated mutations. This is a foundational approach that can be expanded with more complex models or deeper genomic insights.
