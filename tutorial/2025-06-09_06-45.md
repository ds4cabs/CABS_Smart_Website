# Question: How can we use Python to analyze DNA sequences and predict possible mutations?

## Solution

This tutorial demonstrates how to analyze DNA sequences to identify potential mutations using `Biopython`, a powerful library for biological computation.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and the Biopython library installed. You can install Biopython using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step-by-Step Code Tutorial

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio import SeqIO
```

2. **Load a DNA Sequence**
   Load a DNA sequence from a FASTA file or define it directly in the code.

```python
# Define a DNA sequence directly
dna_sequence = Seq("ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA")

# Alternatively, read from a FASTA file
# dna_sequence = SeqIO.read("example.fasta", "fasta").seq
```

3. **Identify Potential Mutations**
   Define a function to identify mutations by comparing with a reference sequence.

```python
def find_mutations(reference_seq, new_seq):
    mutations = []
    for ref_base, new_base in zip(reference_seq, new_seq):
        if ref_base != new_base:
            mutations.append((reference_seq.index(ref_base), ref_base, new_base))
    return mutations
```

4. **Define a Reference Sequence**
   For example, let's consider a reference sequence against which we will compare.

```python
reference_sequence = Seq("ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA")
new_sequence = Seq("ATGCGTACGTAGCCGCTAGCTCGCTA")  # Introduced mutations
```

5. **Analyze and Print the Results**
   Call the mutation function and print the results.

```python
mutations = find_mutations(reference_sequence, new_sequence)
if mutations:
    print("Mutations Found:")
    for mutation in mutations:
        print(f"Position: {mutation[0]}, Reference: {mutation[1]}, New: {mutation[2]}")
else:
    print("No mutations found.")
```

### Complete Code

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq

def find_mutations(reference_seq, new_seq):
    mutations = []
    for ref_base, new_base in zip(reference_seq, new_seq):
        if ref_base != new_base:
            mutations.append((reference_seq.index(ref_base), ref_base, new_base))
    return mutations

# Define DNA sequences
reference_sequence = Seq("ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA")
new_sequence = Seq("ATGCGTACGTAGCCGCTAGCTCGCTA")  # Introduced mutations

# Analyze and print results
mutations = find_mutations(reference_sequence, new_sequence)
if mutations:
    print("Mutations Found:")
    for mutation in mutations:
        print(f"Position: {mutation[0]}, Reference: {mutation[1]}, New: {mutation[2]}")
else:
    print("No mutations found.")
```

### Conclusion
This tutorial provided a comprehensive guide to using Python for DNA sequence analysis, specifically focusing on mutation detection using the Biopython library. You can expand this analysis by incorporating more biological data and conducting further investigations based on identified mutations.
