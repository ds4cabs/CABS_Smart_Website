# Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Gene Expression Prediction

## Question
How can we use machine learning to predict gene expression levels from transcriptomic data using Python?

## Solution

This tutorial will walk you through the process of developing a machine learning model to predict gene expression levels using the `scikit-learn` library in Python. We will utilize a dataset containing gene expression data along with features that describe the biological samples.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset
Assuming we have a CSV file `gene_expression.csv` containing features and target gene expression levels.
```python
# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Separate features and labels, and perform train-test split.
```python
# Features and target separation
X = data.drop('gene_expression', axis=1)  # Features
y = data['gene_expression']                 # Target

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 4: Feature Scaling
Standardize features to improve model performance.
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 5: Model Training
Utilize a Random Forest Regressor for gene expression prediction.
```python
# Initialize the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
```python
# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Calculate MSE
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

### Step 7: Feature Importance
Identify which features are most influential in predicting gene expression.
```python
# Feature importance
importances = model.feature_importances_
feature_importances = pd.Series(importances, index=X.columns)

# Plotting feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
feature_importances.nlargest(10).plot(kind='barh')
plt.title('Top 10 Feature Importance')
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion
You have now implemented a complete machine learning pipeline to predict gene expression using Python. This model can be further improved by tuning hyperparameters and exploring different algorithms.
