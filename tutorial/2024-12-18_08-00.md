# Question: How can we use Python to perform machine learning on genomic data to predict disease phenotypes?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will utilize Python to create a simple machine learning model that predicts disease phenotypes based on genomic features. We will employ the `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `numpy` libraries for data handling and modeling.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset

For this tutorial, we'll use a hypothetical genomic dataset `genomic_data.csv` containing various genomic features and a target phenotype.

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('genomic_data.csv')

# Inspect the data
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Preprocess the Data

We will split the dataset into features and target, and perform train-test splitting.

```python
# Define features and target
X = data.drop('phenotype', axis=1)  # Drop target column
y = data['phenotype']  # Target column

# Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 4: Train a Machine Learning Model

We will use the Random Forest classifier for our model.

```python
# Initialize the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 5: Make Predictions

Now, we will use our model to make predictions on the test set.

```python
# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model

Evaluate the performance of the model using a confusion matrix and classification report.

```python
# Confusion Matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", conf_matrix)

# Classification Report
class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print("Classification Report:\n", class_report)
```

### Step 7: Conclusion

We have built a simple machine learning model to predict disease phenotypes based on genomic features. This foundational approach can be extended with more complex models, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced feature selection techniques to improve performance.
