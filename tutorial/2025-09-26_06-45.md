# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and identify possible mutations that may impact protein functions using bioinformatics techniques?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of analyzing a genomic sequence in Python. We'll use Biopython to fetch a sequence and identify mutations that may affect protein functions.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Biopython installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Step 1: Fetch a Genomic Sequence

We will fetch a genomic sequence using Biopython's Entrez module.

```python
from Bio import Entrez, SeqIO

# Set your email here
Entrez.email = "your_email@example.com"

# Fetch a genomic DNA sequence from NCBI
def fetch_sequence(accession_number):
    handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id=accession_number, rettype="gb", retmode="text")
    record = SeqIO.read(handle, "genbank")
    handle.close()
    return record

# Example accession number for human BRCA1 gene
accession_number = "NM_007294"
genome_record = fetch_sequence(accession_number)

print(f"Fetched sequence for {genome_record.id}:")
print(genome_record.seq)
```

## Step 2: Analyze the Sequence for Mutations

Next, we will define a function that checks for mutations in a specific region of the gene.

```python
def find_mutations(reference_seq, mutation_seq):
    mutations = []
    for ref, mut in zip(reference_seq, mutation_seq):
        if ref != mut:
            mutations.append((ref, mut))
    return mutations

# Let's assume we have a mutated sequence
mutated_sequence = "ATGCCGTGACCTTCAAGTTGTCAT"

# Find mutations
mutations = find_mutations(str(genome_record.seq), mutated_sequence)

print("Identified mutations:")
for ref, mut in mutations:
    print(f"Reference: {ref} -> Mutation: {mut}")
```

## Step 3: Assess the Impact of Mutations

Now we can assess the possible impacts of mutations on protein function. A simple way to do this is to check if they occur in coding regions.

```python
def check_coding_regions(genome_record):
    for feature in genome_record.features:
        if feature.type == "CDS":
            print(f"Protein Coding Region: {feature.location}")
            coding_seq = feature.extract(genome_record.seq)
            print(f"Coding Sequence: {coding_seq}")

# Check coding regions in the fetched genome record
check_coding_regions(genome_record)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to fetch genomic sequences, identify mutations, and assess their impacts on protein functions. This approach can be adapted for various bioinformatics applications, including genomic analysis, mutation impact prediction, and evolutionary studies.
