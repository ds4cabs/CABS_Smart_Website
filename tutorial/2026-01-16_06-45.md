# Question: How can we use Python to analyze gene expression data and identify differentially expressed genes?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will utilize the `pandas` library for data manipulation and `statsmodels` for statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes from an RNA-seq dataset.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas statsmodels
```

### Step 2: Load the Data

Assume you have a CSV file named `gene_expression_data.csv` with the following structure:

| Gene_ID | Control_1 | Control_2 | Treatment_1 | Treatment_2 |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| GeneA   | 10        | 12        | 20          | 22          |
| GeneB   | 5         | 6         | 12          | 14          |
| GeneC   | 8         | 7         | 9           | 10          |

Load the data into a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the gene expression data
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression_data.csv')
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Calculate Mean Expression Levels

Calculate the mean expression levels for control and treatment groups.

```python
data['Control_Mean'] = data[['Control_1', 'Control_2']].mean(axis=1)
data['Treatment_Mean'] = data[['Treatment_1', 'Treatment_2']].mean(axis=1)
```

### Step 4: Perform t-test for Differential Expression

We will perform a t-test to identify differentially expressed genes.

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols

results = {}
for index, row in data.iterrows():
    control = [row['Control_1'], row['Control_2']]
    treatment = [row['Treatment_1'], row['Treatment_2']]
    
    # Perform t-test
    t_test = sm.stats.ttest_ind(control, treatment)
    results[row['Gene_ID']] = {
        'Control_Mean': row['Control_Mean'],
        'Treatment_Mean': row['Treatment_Mean'],
        't-statistic': t_test[0],
        'p-value': t_test[1]
    }

# Convert the results to a DataFrame
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results).T
print(results_df)
```

### Step 5: Identify Differentially Expressed Genes

Filter the results based on a p-value threshold (e.g., 0.05).

```python
# Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
degs = results_df[results_df['p-value'] < 0.05]
print("Differentially Expressed Genes:")
print(degs)
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to use Python to analyze gene expression data and identify differentially expressed genes using statistical methods. You can expand upon this by incorporating more sophisticated techniques, such as adjusting for multiple comparisons or using machine learning algorithms for further analysis.
