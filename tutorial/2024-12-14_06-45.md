# Question
How can we leverage advanced AI techniques in Python to analyze genomic data for disease prediction?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will implement a machine learning model using Python to predict the probability of a disease based on genomic data. We will use a synthetic dataset to demonstrate the process from data loading to model evaluation.

## Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## Step 2: Load Synthetic Genomic Data

We will create a synthetic dataset mimicking genomic features.

```python
# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 1000
num_features = 20

# Features: synthetic genomic data
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)

# Labels: 1 for disease, 0 for no disease
y = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=num_samples)

# Create a DataFrame
genomic_data = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=[f'gene_{i}' for i in range(num_features)])
genomic_data['label'] = y
```

## Step 3: Split the Dataset

```python
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(genomic_data.drop('label', axis=1), 
                                                    genomic_data['label'], 
                                                    test_size=0.2, 
                                                    random_state=42)
```

## Step 4: Train a Random Forest Classifier

```python
# Initialize the Random Forest Classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 5: Make Predictions

```python
# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Step 6: Evaluate the Model

```python
# Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
print('Classification Report:')
print(report)
```

## Step 7: Visualize Feature Importance

```python
# Visualize feature importance
feature_importances = model.feature_importances_
indices = np.argsort(feature_importances)[::-1]

plt.figure()
plt.title("Feature Importances")
plt.bar(range(X_train.shape[1]), feature_importances[indices], align="center")
plt.xticks(range(X_train.shape[1]), [f'gene_{i}' for i in indices], rotation=90)
plt.xlim([-1, X_train.shape[1]])
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to analyze genomic data using a Random Forest Classifier in Python. We covered data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of feature importance, which can help in identifying key genomic features associated with disease.
