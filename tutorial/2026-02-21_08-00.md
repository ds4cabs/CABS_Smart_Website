# Question: How can we use Python and BioPython to analyze DNA sequences for motifs?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python along with the BioPython library to find specific motifs in a DNA sequence. We will search for the motif "ATG" (start codon) and "TAG" (stop codon) within a given DNA sequence.

### Step 1: Install BioPython

If you haven't already installed BioPython, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Required Libraries

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Define the DNA Sequence

For demonstration purposes, we will define a sample DNA sequence:

```python
dna_sequence = Seq("ATGCGATACGTAGCTAGCTAGCGATCGATCGATG")
```

### Step 4: Define the Motif Search Function

We will create a function to search for the motifs within the DNA sequence. 

```python
def find_motifs(dna_seq, motifs):
    positions = {}
    for motif in motifs:
        pos = []
        start = 0
        while True:
            start = dna_seq.find(motif, start)
            if start == -1: 
                break
            pos.append(start)
            start += 1  # Move to the next position
        positions[motif] = pos
    return positions
```

### Step 5: Run the Motif Search

Now, let’s define the motifs we are interested in and call the search function.

```python
motifs_to_search = ["ATG", "TAG"]
motif_positions = find_motifs(dna_sequence, motifs_to_search)

for motif, positions in motif_positions.items():
    print(f"Motif: {motif} found at positions: {positions}")
```

### Example Output

When you run the code, you should see an output similar to the following:

```
Motif: ATG found at positions: [0, 30]
Motif: TAG found at positions: [10, 20]
```

### Conclusion

This simple tutorial demonstrates how to search for specific motifs within a DNA sequence using Python with the BioPython library. You can expand the functionality by incorporating more complex analyses, such as pattern recognition, statistical significance of motif occurrences, and integration with genomic datasets.
