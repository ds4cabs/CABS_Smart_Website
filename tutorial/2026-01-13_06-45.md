# How can we use Python for sequence alignment in bioinformatics?

In bioinformatics, sequence alignment is pivotal for comparing genetic sequences. This tutorial demonstrates how to perform local sequence alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm with the Biopython library.

### Solution

```python
# Step 1: Install Biopython if you haven't already
# You can run this in your terminal or command prompt
# pip install biopython

# Step 2: Import necessary libraries from Biopython
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Step 3: Define your sequences
seq1 = "AGCTGAC"
seq2 = "CGTAC"

# Step 4: Perform local alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.localxx(seq1, seq2)

# Step 5: Display the top alignment
print("Top Local Alignment:")
print(format_alignment(*alignments[0]))
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Ensure that the Biopython library is installed.
- **Step 2**: Import functions for pairwise alignment.
- **Step 3**: Define two sequences you want to compare.
- **Step 4**: Utilize the `localxx` function which performs local alignment.
- **Step 5**: Print the best alignment in a readable format.

### Conclusion

The above code provides a straightforward way to perform local sequence alignment using Python and Biopython, instrumental in many bioinformatics applications such as analyzing gene sequences and identifying mutations.
