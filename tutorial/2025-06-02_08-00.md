# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for identifying potential mutations associated with diseases?

# Solution
In this tutorial, we'll write a Python script that analyzes genomic sequences, identifies mutations, and evaluates their potential impact. We'll use the Biopython library for parsing genomic data.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed (version 3.6 or higher)
- Biopython library installed. You can install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install biopython
  ```

## Step 1: Import Required Libraries
```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
```

## Step 2: Load Genomic Sequences
We will load a sample genomic sequence file in FASTA format.
```python
# Load genomic sequences from a FASTA file
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(record)
    return sequences
```

## Step 3: Identify Mutations
We will compare the loaded sequences against a reference sequence.
```python
def identify_mutations(reference_seq, target_seq):
    mutations = []
    
    for ref_base, target_base in zip(reference_seq, target_seq):
        if ref_base != target_base:
            mutations.append((ref_base, target_base))
    
    return mutations
```

## Step 4: Evaluate Mutations for Disease Association
We can define potential disease relevance based on known mutations.
```python
def evaluate_mutations(mutations):
    disease_associations = {
        'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'  # Example set of known mutation characters
    }
    
    relevant_mutations = []
    for mutation in mutations:
        if mutation[1] in disease_associations:
            relevant_mutations.append(mutation)
    
    return relevant_mutations
```

## Step 5: Main Function to Run Analysis
Combining all the functions to run the analysis on a given sample.
```python
def main(reference_file, target_file):
    reference_sequences = load_sequences(reference_file)
    target_sequences = load_sequences(target_file)

    for ref_record, target_record in zip(reference_sequences, target_sequences):
        mutations = identify_mutations(ref_record.seq, target_record.seq)
        relevant_mutations = evaluate_mutations(mutations)

        print(f"Mutations for {target_record.id}: {relevant_mutations}")

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main("reference_genome.fasta", "target_genome.fasta")
```

## Notes
- Make sure to replace `"reference_genome.fasta"` and `"target_genome.fasta"` with actual file paths to your genomic data files.
- The disease associations in `evaluate_mutations` should be expanded based on real known mutations for better accuracy.

You now have a Python script that analyzes genomic sequences to identify and evaluate mutations based on their potential association with diseases.
