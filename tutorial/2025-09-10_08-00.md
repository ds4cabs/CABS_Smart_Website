# Tutorial: Advanced AI in Bioinformatics - Gene Expression Classification

## Question
How can we utilize advanced AI techniques to classify gene expression data using machine learning?

## Solution
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to classify gene expression data using Python with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. We will use a dataset that contains gene expression profiles of different cancer types.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow numpy
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
```

### Step 3: Load Dataset
Assuming you have a CSV file `gene_expression.csv` with features as gene expression levels and labels as cancer types.

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv')
X = data.drop('label', axis=1).values  # Features (gene expression levels)
y = data['label'].values                # Labels (cancer types)
```

### Step 4: Split the Data
Split the data into training and testing sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Scale Features
Normalize the gene expression data.

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 6: Build the Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Construct an ANN model using TensorFlow.

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(len(np.unique(y)), activation='softmax')  # Output layer
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Step 7: Train the Model
Train the model with the training set.

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=10, validation_split=0.2)
```

### Step 8: Evaluate the Model
Assess the model's performance on the test set.

```python
y_pred = np.argmax(model.predict(X_test), axis=-1)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Step 9: Save the Model
Save your trained model for future use.

```python
model.save('gene_expression_model.h5')
```

### Conclusion
We have successfully built and trained a neural network to classify gene expression data. You can further improve the model by fine-tuning its architecture, hyperparameters, and exploring more advanced techniques like transfer learning or ensemble methods.
