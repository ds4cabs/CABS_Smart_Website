# Question: How can we use Python to perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics?

## Solution: Implementing Sequence Alignment with Biopython

Sequence alignment is a crucial technique in bioinformatics used to identify similarities between biological sequences. In this tutorial, we will use Biopython, a popular library, to perform global sequence alignment.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Biopython installed. You can install Biopython using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step-by-Step Code Example

Here’s how to perform a global alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

```python
# Import necessary modules from Biopython
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Define two sequences
seq1 = "ACGTGAC"
seq2 = "ACGTCAC"

# Perform global alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)

# Print the top alignment
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Import Modules**: We import `pairwise2` from `Bio` which contains the alignment functions.
   
2. **Define Sequences**: Two DNA sequences (`seq1` and `seq2`) are defined for alignment.

3. **Perform Global Alignment**: `pairwise2.align.globalxx` function is called to perform the global alignment without any scoring parameters. The default scoring system assigns a score of 1 for matches and 0 for mismatches.

4. **Display Alignments**: The alignments are printed in a human-readable format using the `format_alignment` function.

### Example Output

You can expect an output similar to this:

```
ACGT-GAC
ACGTC-AC
  |  |
  1  0
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement global sequence alignment using Biopython. By leveraging this tool, bioinformaticians can perform valuable comparisons of biological sequences.
