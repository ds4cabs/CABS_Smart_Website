# Question
How can we use Python to analyze DNA sequences and identify potential mutations using the Biopython library?

# Solution

## Introduction
Bioinformatics involves the application of computer technology to understand biological data, and DNA sequence analysis is a key area. This tutorial will demonstrate how to analyze DNA sequences and identify potential mutations using Python's Biopython library.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and Biopython installed. You can install Biopython using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Step-by-Step Code Tutorial

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
```

### Step 2: Read DNA Sequence from File

Assume we have a FASTA file named `sequence.fasta` containing a DNA sequence.

```python
sequence_file = 'sequence.fasta'
sequences = SeqIO.parse(sequence_file, 'fasta')

for record in sequences:
    original_sequence = str(record.seq)
    print(f"Original Sequence: {original_sequence}")
```

### Step 3: Calculate GC Content

```python
gc_content = GC(original_sequence)
print(f"GC Content: {gc_content}%")
```

### Step 4: Identify Potential Mutations

Letâ€™s specify a reference sequence and check for differences.

```python
reference_sequence = "ATGCGTGACGTTAGC"
print(f"Reference Sequence: {reference_sequence}")

mutations = []
for i in range(min(len(original_sequence), len(reference_sequence))):
    if original_sequence[i] != reference_sequence[i]:
        mutations.append((i, original_sequence[i], reference_sequence[i]))

print("Potential Mutations (Position, Original, Reference):")
for mutation in mutations:
    print(mutation)
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you have learned how to read DNA sequences from a file, calculate GC content, and identify potential mutations compared to a reference sequence using the Biopython library. This foundational workflow can be expanded for more complex analyses in bioinformatics.
