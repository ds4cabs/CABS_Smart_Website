# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic data for identifying potential gene mutations associated with diseases?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will utilize the `Biopython` library to analyze genomic data. We'll be focusing on identifying mutations in a gene sequence related to a specific disease by comparing it against a reference sequence.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have `Biopython` installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment
```

### Step 3: Load Reference and Sample Genomic Data

For this example, we will use hypothetical FASTA files for reference and sample sequences.

```python
# Load reference sequence
reference = SeqIO.read("reference_sequence.fasta", "fasta")

# Load sample sequence
sample = SeqIO.read("sample_sequence.fasta", "fasta")
```

### Step 4: Align Sequences

Using pairwise alignment to find mutations.

```python
# Perform alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(reference.seq, sample.seq)

# Display the best alignment
best_alignment = alignments[0]
print(format_alignment(*best_alignment))
```

### Step 5: Identify Mutations

Identify positions where mutations occur.

```python
def identify_mutations(reference_seq, sample_seq):
    mutations = []
    for i, (ref_base, sample_base) in enumerate(zip(reference_seq, sample_seq)):
        if ref_base != sample_base:
            mutations.append((i + 1, ref_base, sample_base))  # 1-based index
    return mutations

mutations = identify_mutations(reference.seq, sample.seq)

# Print mutations
for position, ref_base, sample_base in mutations:
    print(f"Mutation at position {position}: {ref_base} -> {sample_base}")
```

### Step 6: Conclusion

The code above will output the mutations found in the sample sequence compared to the reference, indicating potential gene mutations associated with diseases. Save your genomic sequences in the appropriate FASTA format to analyze your data effectively.

### Example Output

Assuming the reference and sample sequences contain differences, you might see an output like:

```
Mutation at position 15: A -> T
Mutation at position 22: C -> G
```

This method provides a straightforward way to identify genetic variations, helping in understanding the underlying genetic factors in diseases.
