# Question
How can we use Python to implement a machine learning model for predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on sequence features?

# Solution

### Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Load Sequence Data
Assume we have a FASTA file containing protein sequences along with their interaction labels in a CSV.

```python
# Load sequences from FASTA file
def load_fasta(fasta_file):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

# Load interaction labels
def load_labels(csv_file):
    return pd.read_csv(csv_file)

fasta_file = 'proteins.fasta'  # Path to the FASTA file
csv_file = 'interactions.csv'    # Path to the CSV file

sequences = load_fasta(fasta_file)
labels = load_labels(csv_file)
```

### Step 4: Feature Extraction
Extract features such as amino acid composition.

```python
def extract_features(sequences):
    features = []
    for seq_id, seq in sequences.items():
        aa_count = {aa: seq.count(aa) for aa in 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'}  # Amino acids
        features.append(list(aa_count.values()))
    return features

features = extract_features(sequences)
```

### Step 5: Prepare Dataset
Combine features and labels into a DataFrame.

```python
# Create DataFrame
features_df = pd.DataFrame(features, columns=[f'count_{aa}' for aa in 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'])
labels_df = pd.DataFrame(labels)

# Merge features with labels
dataset = pd.concat([features_df, labels_df], axis=1)
X = dataset.drop('interaction_label', axis=1)
y = dataset['interaction_label']
```

### Step 6: Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 7: Train the Model
Use a Random Forest classifier for training.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 8: Evaluate the Model
Assess the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
