# How can we use Python for sequence alignment in bioinformatics?

### Solution

Sequence alignment is a critical task in bioinformatics used to identify regions of similarity between biological sequences. Here, we will demonstrate how to perform sequence alignment using the `Biopython` library.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `Biopython` installed. You can install it via pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Code Example

```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Define two sequences to align
seq1 = "ACGTAG"
seq2 = "ACGTCG"

# Perform global alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)

# Output the best alignment
best_alignment = alignments[0]
print("Best Alignment:")
print(format_alignment(*best_alignment))
```

### Explanation

1. **Import necessary modules**: We import the required functions from the `Biopython` library.
   
2. **Define sequences**: Two sequences, `seq1` and `seq2`, are defined for alignment.

3. **Global alignment**: We use the `globalxx` method from `pairwise2` to perform global alignment, which finds the best match by aligning the entire length of both sequences.

4. **Output format**: We format and print the best alignment results.

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates a straightforward method to perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics using Python. The Biopython library simplifies complex biological computations, making it easier to focus on data analysis and interpretation.
