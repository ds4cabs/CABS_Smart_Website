# Question:
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences using advanced AI techniques, specifically applying machine learning models for gene classification?

# Solution:

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries
You need to install the following libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `biopython`. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn biopython
```

## Step 2: Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
```

## Step 3: Load and Preprocess Genomic Data
Assuming we have a FASTA file (`sequences.fasta`) containing the genomic sequences and a corresponding CSV file (`labels.csv`) with labels.

### Loading Sequences

```python
def load_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
    return sequences

sequences = load_sequences("sequences.fasta")
```

### Loading Labels

```python
labels_df = pd.read_csv("labels.csv")
labels = labels_df['label'].values
```

## Step 4: Feature Extraction
We'll convert nucleotide sequences to numerical features using k-mer counting.

```python
def kmer_count(sequences, k=3):
    kmer_dict = {}
    for seq in sequences:
        seq_length = len(seq)
        for i in range(seq_length - k + 1):
            kmer = seq[i:i+k]
            if kmer in kmer_dict:
                kmer_dict[kmer] += 1
            else:
                kmer_dict[kmer] = 1
    return kmer_dict

kmer_features = [kmer_count([seq], k=3) for seq in sequences]
kmer_df = pd.DataFrame(kmer_features).fillna(0)
```

## Step 5: Encode Labels
```python
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)
```

## Step 6: Train-Test Split
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(kmer_df, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 7: Train Model
Using a Random Forest Classifier for gene classification.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 8: Evaluate Model
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=label_encoder.classes_)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
```

## Conclusion
You have successfully built a machine learning model to classify gene sequences based on their k-mer features. You can experiment with different classifiers and feature extraction techniques for improved performance.
