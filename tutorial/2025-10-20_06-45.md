# Question
How can we use Python to perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics with advanced techniques?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will explore how to perform sequence alignment using the `Biopython` library, which provides tools for biological computation. We will focus on how to use the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have `Biopython` installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment
```

### Step 2: Define Sequences

```python
# Sample DNA sequences
seq1 = "AGCTGAC"
seq2 = "AGCTGTT"
```

### Step 3: Perform Sequence Alignment

```python
# Perform global alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)
```

### Step 4: Display Alignments

```python
# Print the alignments
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Example Output
The output will show the aligned sequences with their corresponding scores. For instance:

```
AGCTGAC
|| ||||
AGCTGTT
  Score=5
```

### Step 5: Custom Scoring

You can set custom scoring for matches, mismatches, and gaps. Here's how:

```python
# Custom scoring
match_score = 2
mismatch_score = -1
gap_open_score = -0.5
gap_extend_score = -0.1

alignments = pairwise2.align.global_msmatch(seq1, seq2, match_score, mismatch_score, gap_open_score, gap_extend_score)

for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Conclusion
Using the `Biopython` library, we can easily perform advanced sequence alignment using different scoring strategies, aiding in various bioinformatics analyses such as genetic research, evolutionary studies, and more.
