# Question: How Can We Use Python for Sequence Alignment in Bioinformatics?

Sequence alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics used to identify similarities between DNA, RNA, or protein sequences that may indicate functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships.

## Solution

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Example Code

The following script demonstrates how to perform pairwise sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with the Biopython library.

```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Define the sequences
seq1 = "AGCTGTA"
seq2 = "AGCTGCA"

# Perform the alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)

# Print the alignments
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Libraries**: The script imports necessary modules from the Biopython library.
  
2. **Define Sequences**: Two sample sequences, `seq1` and `seq2`, are defined for alignment.

3. **Perform Alignment**: The `pairwise2.align.globalxx()` function is used for global alignment without gap penalties or scoring.

4. **Print Alignments**: A loop is used to format and print each alignment.

### Example Output

The output of the above script might look like this:

```
  AGCTGTA
  ||  |||
  AGCTGCA
  Score=5
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial provides a basic introduction to performing sequence alignment in bioinformatics using Python and Biopython. You can further explore scoring systems and gap penalties to tailor the alignment process to specific biological questions.
