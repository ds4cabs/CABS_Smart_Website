# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for mutations associated with a specific disease using bioinformatics libraries?

# Solution

## Requirements
To perform this analysis, you'll need to install the following libraries:
- Biopython
- pandas

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython pandas
```

## Step 1: Import Required Libraries
```python
from Bio import SeqIO
import pandas as pd
```

## Step 2: Load Genomic Sequences
Assume you have a FASTA file named `sequences.fasta` containing genomic sequences.

```python
def load_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences.append((record.id, str(record.seq)))
    return pd.DataFrame(sequences, columns=['ID', 'Sequence'])

sequences_df = load_sequences('sequences.fasta')
```

## Step 3: Identify Mutations
Let's define a function to compare sequences and identify mutations against a reference sequence.

```python
def find_mutations(reference_seq, sample_seq):
    mutations = []
    for i, (ref_nuc, samp_nuc) in enumerate(zip(reference_seq, sample_seq)):
        if ref_nuc != samp_nuc:
            mutations.append((i + 1, ref_nuc, samp_nuc))  # position, reference base, sample base
    return mutations
```

## Step 4: Analyze a Specific Sample
Consider the first sequence in the DataFrame as the reference sequence and the second as the sample.

```python
reference_sequence = sequences_df.iloc[0]['Sequence']
sample_sequence = sequences_df.iloc[1]['Sequence']

mutations = find_mutations(reference_sequence, sample_sequence)
```

## Step 5: Output the Results
Display the mutations found.

```python
print("Mutations found:")
for mutation in mutations:
    print(f"Position: {mutation[0]}, Reference: {mutation[1]}, Sample: {mutation[2]}")
```

## Conclusion
This Python script reads genomic sequences from a FASTA file, compares a sample sequence against a reference sequence, and identifies mutations. By adjusting the file names and sequences, you can easily adapt this code to other genomic analyses in bioinformatics.
