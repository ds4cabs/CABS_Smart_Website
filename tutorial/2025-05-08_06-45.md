# How can we use Python for DNA Sequence Analysis in Bioinformatics?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will explore how to analyze DNA sequences using Python. We will focus on computing the GC content of a DNA sequence, finding the reverse complement, and searching for specific motifs within the sequence.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the Biopython library. You can install Biopython using the following command:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 1: Calculate GC Content

The GC content of a DNA sequence is the percentage of nucleotides in the sequence that are either Guanine (G) or Cytosine (C).

#### Code:

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq

def gc_content(seq):
    g_count = seq.count('G')
    c_count = seq.count('C')
    total = len(seq)
    gc_ratio = (g_count + c_count) / total
    return gc_ratio * 100

# Example Usage
dna_sequence = "AGCTTAGCCTAGCTAGGCTT"
gc_percentage = gc_content(dna_sequence)
print(f"GC Content: {gc_percentage:.2f}%")
```

### Step 2: Find Reverse Complement

The reverse complement of a DNA sequence is a sequence that is reversed and has complementary nucleotides.

#### Code:

```python
def reverse_complement(seq):
    complement = {'A': 'T', 'T': 'A', 'C': 'G', 'G': 'C'}
    rev_comp = ''.join(complement[nucleotide] for nucleotide in reversed(seq))
    return rev_comp

# Example Usage
reverse_dna = reverse_complement(dna_sequence)
print(f"Reverse Complement: {reverse_dna}")
```

### Step 3: Search for a Motif

Searching for specific motifs (short sequences) within a DNA sequence is crucial for various bioinformatics applications.

#### Code:

```python
def find_motif(seq, motif):
    positions = []
    start = 0
    while True:
        start = seq.find(motif, start)
        if start == -1: 
            break
        positions.append(start)
        start += 1  # Move to the next position
    return positions

# Example Usage
motif = "AGC"
motif_positions = find_motif(dna_sequence, motif)
print(f"Motif '{motif}' found at positions: {motif_positions}")
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to compute the GC content, find the reverse complement, and search for motifs in DNA sequences using Python. These fundamental techniques are integral in the field of bioinformatics for analyzing genetic information.
