# How to Use Python for Advanced AI Applications in Bioinformatics?

## Problem Statement
In bioinformatics, we often need to analyze genetic sequences to find patterns or predict mutations. One common task is building a predictive model to classify gene mutations based on features derived from nucleotide sequences.

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Load Genetic Sequence Data

Assume you have a file `genes.fasta` containing multiple sequences and mutations labeled in a CSV file `labels.csv`.

```python
# Load sequences from a FASTA file
def load_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

sequences = load_sequences('genes.fasta')

# Load gene mutation labels
labels_df = pd.read_csv('labels.csv')
```

### Step 4: Feature Extraction

Extract features from the sequences. As an example, let's calculate the GC content as a feature.

```python
def gc_content(sequence):
    return (sequence.count('G') + sequence.count('C')) / len(sequence)

# Create feature DataFrame
features = pd.DataFrame()
features['id'] = labels_df['id']
features['gc_content'] = features['id'].map(lambda x: gc_content(sequences[x]))

# Merge features with labels
data = features.merge(labels_df, on='id')
```

### Step 5: Train-Test Split

```python
X = data[['gc_content']]
y = data['mutation_label']  # Assuming this column contains mutation labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 6: Model Training

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 7: Predictions

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 8: Evaluation

```python
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Conclusion
You have successfully built a machine learning model to classify gene mutations based on extracted features from genetic sequences. Adjust feature extraction and model parameters for better performance as needed.
