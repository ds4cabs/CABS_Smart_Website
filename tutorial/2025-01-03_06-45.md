# Question
How can we perform sequence alignment using advanced AI techniques in bioinformatics with Python?

# Solution

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install Biopython numpy pandas
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Align import MultipleSeqAlignment
from Bio.Align import aligner
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

### Step 2: Load Sequences
Load your sequences from a FASTA file.
```python
sequences = list(SeqIO.parse("sequences.fasta", "fasta"))
```

### Step 3: Prepare Data for Alignment
```python
# Extract sequence strings
seqs = [str(record.seq) for record in sequences]
```

### Step 4: Define an Alignment Function
Using a basic dynamic programming approach.
```python
def align_sequences(sequences):
    # Basic parameters
    match_score = 1
    gap_penalty = -1

    # Initialize score matrix
    n = len(sequences[0])
    m = len(sequences)
    score_matrix = np.zeros((m + 1, n + 1))

    # Fill in the score matrix
    for i in range(m + 1):
        score_matrix[i][0] = gap_penalty * i
    for j in range(n + 1):
        score_matrix[0][j] = gap_penalty * j

    # Dynamic programming fill
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            match = score_matrix[i-1][j-1] + (match_score if sequences[i-1][j-1] == sequences[i-1][j-1] else 0)
            delete = score_matrix[i-1][j] + gap_penalty
            insert = score_matrix[i][j-1] + gap_penalty
            score_matrix[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)

    return score_matrix
```

### Step 5: Perform Alignment
```python
alignment = align_sequences(seqs)
```

### Step 6: Display Results
Convert the score matrix into a DataFrame for better visualization.
```python
alignment_df = pd.DataFrame(alignment)
print(alignment_df)
```

### Conclusion
This tutorial detailed how to perform sequence alignment using a dynamic programming approach in Python. You can extend this example by incorporating machine learning models for more sophisticated alignment techniques.
