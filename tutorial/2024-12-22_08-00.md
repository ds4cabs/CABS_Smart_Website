## Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic data for variant association studies?

### Solution

In this tutorial, we'll analyze genomic data to identify potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a phenotype using Python's `pandas` and `statsmodels` libraries.

### Requirements

Make sure to install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas statsmodels
```

### Dataset

We will use a hypothetical CSV file named `genomic_data.csv` with the following structure:

```
snp_id, genotype, phenotype
rs1, AA, 1
rs2, AG, 0
rs3, GG, 1
rs4, GG, 0
...
```

### Step 1: Load the Data

First, we need to load the genomic data.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('genomic_data.csv')
print(data.head())
```

### Step 2: Encode Genotype

We will convert the genotype into a binary format suitable for statistical analysis.

```python
# Encoding genotypes: AA=0, AG=1, GG=2
def encode_genotype(genotype):
    if genotype == 'AA':
        return 0
    elif genotype == 'AG':
        return 1
    else:
        return 2

data['genotype_encoded'] = data['genotype'].apply(encode_genotype)
```

### Step 3: Perform Logistic Regression

Now, we will use logistic regression to find associations between SNPs and phenotypes.

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Prepare the model
X = sm.add_constant(data['genotype_encoded'])  # Add a constant for the intercept
y = data['phenotype']

# Fit the model
model = sm.Logit(y, X)
result = model.fit()

# Print the summary
print(result.summary())
```

### Step 4: Interpret Results

After running the model, you will see the coefficients and p-values that indicate the strength of association for each SNP. Look for low p-values (typically < 0.05) to find significant associations.

### Conclusion

This simple Python tutorial demonstrated how to leverage genomic data for variant association studies utilizing logistic regression. You can expand this framework by incorporating more complex statistical models and larger datasets to improve your analysis!
