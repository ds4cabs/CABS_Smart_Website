# How can we use Python for Genome Sequence Analysis with AI?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will explore how to leverage Python along with libraries like Biopython and TensorFlow to analyze genome sequences using advanced AI techniques.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, ensure you have the following libraries installed. You can do this via pip:

```bash
pip install biopython tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Step 2: Load Genome Data

We will use Biopython to load a sample genome sequence. For the sake of this example, let's load a FASTA file.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

# Load the genome sequence from a FASTA file
def load_genome(fasta_file):
    genome = SeqIO.read(fasta_file, "fasta")
    return str(genome.seq)

genome_sequence = load_genome("sample_genome.fasta")
print(genome_sequence[:100])  # Show the first 100 nucleotides
```

### Step 3: Preprocess the Sequence

To feed the sequences into a machine learning model, we need to encode them.

```python
import numpy as np

def encode_sequence(sequence):
    encoding = {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'G': 3, 'T': 4}
    return np.array([encoding[nucleotide] for nucleotide in sequence])

encoded_sequence = encode_sequence(genome_sequence)
print(encoded_sequence[:100])  # Show the encoded values for the first 100 nucleotides
```

### Step 4: Prepare Data for AI Model

We need to split the dataset into training and testing datasets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create input/output pairs (this is just a dummy target for illustration)
X = encoded_sequence[:-1].reshape(-1, 1)  # Features
y = encoded_sequence[1:]                   # Target

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Build the AI Model

We will create a simple neural network model using TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Build the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation='softmax')  # Output layer for 4 nucleotide classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

### Step 6: Train the Model

Now, we can train our neural network. 

```python
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model

Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.

```python
# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_accuracy}')
```

### Step 8: Make Predictions

Using the trained model to make predictions.

```python
# Predict the next nucleotide
predictions = model.predict(X_test[:5])  # Predict the first 5 test samples
predicted_nucleotides = np.argmax(predictions, axis=-1) + 1  # Convert back to original encoding

print(predicted_nucleotides)  # Show the predicted nucleotides
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial provided a basic framework for utilizing Python with AI to perform genome sequence analysis. You can extend and modify this model to include more sophisticated techniques and larger datasets as needed.
