# Question: How can you use Python to perform genomic sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm in Bioinformatics?

## Solution

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for global sequence alignment. Below is a step-by-step tutorial that guides you through implementing this algorithm in Python.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the `numpy` library installed. You can install it using:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Step 1: Initialize the scoring matrix

```python
import numpy as np

def initialize_matrices(seq1, seq2, match=1, mismatch=-1, gap=-2):
    # Create a scoring matrix
    n = len(seq1) + 1
    m = len(seq2) + 1
    score = np.zeros((n, m), dtype=int)
    
    # Fill the first row and column with gap penalties
    for i in range(n):
        score[i][0] = gap * i
    for j in range(m):
        score[0][j] = gap * j
    
    return score
```

### Step 2: Fill the scoring matrix

```python
def fill_matrices(score, seq1, seq2, match=1, mismatch=-1, gap=-2):
    for i in range(1, len(seq1) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(seq2) + 1):
            match_score = score[i - 1][j - 1] + (match if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1] else mismatch)
            delete_score = score[i - 1][j] + gap
            insert_score = score[i][j - 1] + gap
            score[i][j] = max(match_score, delete_score, insert_score)
    return score
```

### Step 3: Traceback to get aligned sequences

```python
def traceback(score, seq1, seq2, gap=-2):
    aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2 = "", ""
    i, j = len(seq1), len(seq2)
    
    while i > 0 or j > 0:
        current_score = score[i][j]
        if i > 0 and j > 0 and (current_score == score[i-1][j-1] + (1 if seq1[i-1] == seq2[j-1] else -1)):
            aligned_seq1 += seq1[i-1]
            aligned_seq2 += seq2[j-1]
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif i > 0 and (current_score == score[i-1][j] + gap):
            aligned_seq1 += seq1[i-1]
            aligned_seq2 += "-"
            i -= 1
        else:
            aligned_seq1 += "-"
            aligned_seq2 += seq2[j-1]
            j -= 1
    
    return aligned_seq1[::-1], aligned_seq2[::-1]
```

### Step 4: Complete alignment function

```python
def needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2):
    score = initialize_matrices(seq1, seq2)
    score = fill_matrices(score, seq1, seq2)
    aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2 = traceback(score, seq1, seq2)
    return aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2, score

# Example usage:
seq1 = "ACGT"
seq2 = "ACGTG"
aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2, score_matrix = needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2)

print("Aligned Sequences:")
print(aligned_seq1)
print(aligned_seq2)
print("Score Matrix:")
print(score_matrix)
```

### Output
The aligned sequences will be printed along with the score matrix, providing insights into the alignment and scoring process. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is essential in bioinformatics for tasks such as sequence alignment and comparative genomics.
