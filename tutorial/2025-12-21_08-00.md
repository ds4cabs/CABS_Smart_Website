# Question

How can we use Python to perform analysis on genomic sequences to identify potential mutations associated with a specific disease?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python to analyze genomic sequences to identify potential mutations. We will utilize the Biopython library to fetch genomic data and perform sequence analysis.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Biopython installed. You can install Biopython with the following command:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Step 1: Fetch Genomic Data

First, we will fetch genomic data from the NCBI database.

```python
from Bio import Entrez

def fetch_genomic_data(accession_number):
    Entrez.email = "your_email@example.com"
    handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id=accession_number, rettype="gb", retmode="text")
    genomic_data = handle.read()
    handle.close()
    return genomic_data

accession_number = "NC_001416"  # Example accession number for human genome
genomic_data = fetch_genomic_data(accession_number)

print(genomic_data[:500])  # Print the first 500 characters of the genomic data
```

## Step 2: Parse the Genomic Data

Next, we will parse the fetched data to extract the relevant sequence.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from io import StringIO

def parse_genomic_data(genomic_data):
    return SeqIO.read(StringIO(genomic_data), "gb")

genome_record = parse_genomic_data(genomic_data)
print(f"Organism: {genome_record.description}")
print(f"Sequence Length: {len(genome_record.seq)}")
```

## Step 3: Identify Mutations

Assume we have a known reference sequence and we want to identify mutations compared to that reference.

```python
def find_mutations(reference_seq, test_seq):
    mutations = []
    for i in range(len(reference_seq)):
        if reference_seq[i] != test_seq[i]:
            mutations.append((i+1, reference_seq[i], test_seq[i]))  # Store position and bases
    return mutations

reference_sequence = "ACGT"  # Example reference sequence
test_sequence = str(genome_record.seq[:4])  # Compare first 4 bases for demonstration

mutations = find_mutations(reference_sequence, test_sequence)
print("Identified Mutations:")
for pos, ref_base, test_base in mutations:
    print(f"Position: {pos}, Reference Base: {ref_base}, Test Base: {test_base}")
```

## Step 4: Save Results

Finally, we can save the identified mutations to a CSV file for later analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd

def save_mutations_to_csv(mutations, filename):
    df = pd.DataFrame(mutations, columns=["Position", "Reference Base", "Test Base"])
    df.to_csv(filename, index=False)

save_mutations_to_csv(mutations, "mutations.csv")
print("Mutations saved to mutations.csv")
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we used Python and the Biopython library to fetch genomic data, analyze it for mutations, and save the results. This methodology can be further expanded to include deeper bioinformatics analyses as required in advanced AI applications within bioinformatics.
