## Question
How can we implement a machine learning model to predict the effectiveness of drug compounds on specific biological targets using Python?

## Solution

Here, we will use Python along with the Scikit-learn library to build a simple machine learning model to classify drug compounds based on their molecular properties. We will leverage the `DrugBank` dataset, which contains information about drug compounds and their interactions.

### Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset

Assuming you have a CSV file `drug_data.csv` with the structure:
- `CompoundID`: Unique identifier for each compound
- `MolecularWeight`: Weight of the molecule
- `LogP`: Partition coefficient
- `Cytotoxicity`: Label indicating if the compound is cytotoxic (1 for yes, 0 for no)

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('drug_data.csv')
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Split the data into features and labels.

```python
X = data[['MolecularWeight', 'LogP']]
y = data['Cytotoxicity']
```

### Step 4: Train-Test Split

Split the data into training and test sets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Build and Train the Model

We will use a RandomForestClassifier for this task.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Initialize the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Make Predictions

Now we can make predictions on the test set.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model

We will evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Print confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print('Confusion Matrix:\n', cm)

# Print classification report
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print('Classification Report:\n', report)
```

### Step 8: Visualize Results

Lastly, we can visualize the confusion matrix.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```
