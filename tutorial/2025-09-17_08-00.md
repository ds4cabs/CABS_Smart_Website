# Question: How can we use Python to perform genetic sequence alignment using BioPython?

## Solution

In bioinformatics, sequence alignment is a common task used to identify regions of similarity between biological sequences. This tutorial demonstrates how to perform sequence alignment using the `Bio` module from the `BioPython` library.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the `Biopython` library installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Code Example

```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Define two genetic sequences
seq1 = "AGCTAGC"
seq2 = "AGCTAGT"

# Perform pairwise alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)

# Display the best alignment
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Explanation

1. **Import necessary modules**: Import the `pairwise2` and `format_alignment` functions from the `Bio` package.
2. **Define sequences**: Set your two genetic sequences that you want to align.
3. **Perform alignment**: Use the `pairwise2.align.globalxx` method for global alignment.
4. **Display results**: Iterate through the alignment results and print the best alignment using `format_alignment`.

### Output

When you run the above code, you will receive output that looks like this:

```
AGCTAGC
|| ||||
AGCTAGT
  Score=6
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial introduced you to performing sequence alignment using the `BioPython` library. This fundamental process is crucial in various applications in bioinformatics such as phylogenetics, functional genomics, and variation analysis.
