# Tutorial: Predicting Protein Structure Using Deep Learning with Python

## Question
How can we use deep learning techniques to predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences in bioinformatics?

## Solution

### Overview
In this tutorial, we will leverage the `Keras` library to build a neural network model that predicts the secondary structure of proteins from their sequences. The secondary structure includes helices, sheets, and coils.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn keras tensorflow biopython
```

### Step 1: Data Preparation
We will use the `SecStr` dataset for training our model. This dataset contains protein sequences and their corresponding secondary structures.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('secstr_dataset.csv')  # ensure you have your dataset
sequences = data['sequence'].values
structures = data['structure'].values

# Encode structures
encoder = LabelEncoder()
structures_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(structures)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sequences, structures_encoded, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 2: Feature Engineering
Convert the amino acid sequences into one-hot encoded vectors.

```python
import numpy as np

def one_hot_encode(sequences):
    amino_acids = "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"  # Standard amino acids
    mapping = {aa: i for i, aa in enumerate(amino_acids)}

    encodings = []
    for seq in sequences:
        encoding = np.zeros((len(seq), len(amino_acids)), dtype=int)
        for i, aa in enumerate(seq):
            if aa in mapping:
                encoding[i, mapping[aa]] = 1
        encodings.append(encoding)
    
    return np.array(encodings)

X_train_encoded = one_hot_encode(X_train)
X_test_encoded = one_hot_encode(X_test)
```

### Step 3: Build the Model
We will build a simple LSTM model to predict the secondary structure.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout, TimeDistributed, Flatten

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train_encoded.shape[1], X_train_encoded.shape[2])))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(len(encoder.classes_), activation='softmax')))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Step 4: Train the Model
Train the model using the training data.

```python
# Reshape the data to fit LSTM expected input
X_train_reshaped = X_train_encoded.reshape((X_train_encoded.shape[0], X_train_encoded.shape[1], -1))
X_test_reshaped = X_test_encoded.reshape((X_test_encoded.shape[0], X_test_encoded.shape[1], -1))

history = model.fit(X_train_reshaped, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1)
```

### Step 5: Evaluate the Model
We will evaluate the performance on the test dataset.

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_reshaped, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```

### Step 6: Making Predictions
Predict the secondary structure for a sample sequence.

```python
sample_sequence = "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"  # Example sequence
sample_encoded = one_hot_encode([sample_sequence]).reshape((1, len(sample_sequence), -1))
prediction = model.predict(sample_encoded)
predicted_structure = encoder.inverse_transform(np.argmax(prediction, axis=-1)[0])
print(f'Predicted Structure: {predicted_structure}')
```

### Conclusion
You have successfully built a deep learning model to predict the secondary structure of proteins. You can further improve this model by using more advanced architectures and larger datasets.
