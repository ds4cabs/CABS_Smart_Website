# Question: How to Implement Sequence Alignment using Biopython?

Sequence alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics used to identify similarities between sequences. Here, we'll demonstrate how to perform sequence alignment using the Biopython library in Python.

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Biopython

If you haven't installed Biopython, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment
```

### Step 3: Define Your Sequences

We'll define two sequences to align.

```python
seq1 = "AGCTAC"
seq2 = "AGCTTC"
```

### Step 4: Perform Pairwise Alignment

Using Biopython’s pairwise2 module, we can perform the alignment.

```python
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)
```

### Step 5: Display the Alignments

Now, let’s print the alignments.

```python
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Full Code Example

Here is the complete code snippet:

```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Define sequences
seq1 = "AGCTAC"
seq2 = "AGCTTC"

# Perform pairwise alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)

# Display alignments
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Output

The output will show the aligned sequences along with the score and the number of matches and gaps:

```
AGCTAC
AGCTTC
  |||||
  01234
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to perform sequence alignment using the Biopython library in Python. Sequence alignment is essential for various applications such as comparing genetic sequences, protein structures, and more.
