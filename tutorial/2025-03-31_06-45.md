# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for mutations in bioinformatics?

## Solution:

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to find mutations in genomic sequences using Python. We will utilize the Biopython library to assist with sequence handling and analysis.

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
```

### Step 2: Load Genomic Sequence

Assume we have a genomic sequence file in FASTA format named `genome.fasta`.

```python
def load_genome(file_path):
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        return record.id, record.seq

genome_id, genome_seq = load_genome("genome.fasta")
print(f"Loaded genome: {genome_id}")
```

### Step 3: Define Mutation Detection Function

We will define a function to compare a reference sequence against a sample sequence and identify mutations.

```python
def find_mutations(reference_seq, sample_seq):
    mutations = []
    for i in range(len(reference_seq)):
        if reference_seq[i] != sample_seq[i]:
            mutations.append((i + 1, reference_seq[i], sample_seq[i]))  # 1-based index for mutations
    return mutations
```

### Step 4: Load Sample Sequence

Assume we have a sample sequence in another FASTA format named `sample.fasta`.

```python
def load_sample(file_path):
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        return record.id, record.seq

sample_id, sample_seq = load_sample("sample.fasta")
print(f"Loaded sample: {sample_id}")
```

### Step 5: Analyze Mutations

Now we will call the mutation detection function and display the results.

```python
mutations = find_mutations(genome_seq, sample_seq)

if mutations:
    print("Mutations found:")
    for position, ref_base, sample_base in mutations:
        print(f"Position: {position}, Reference: {ref_base}, Sample: {sample_base}")
else:
    print("No mutations found.")
```

### Conclusion

This code provides a basic framework for detecting mutations in genomic sequences using Python. By adjusting the reference and sample sequences as needed, this method can facilitate various bioinformatics analyses.
