# Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Gene Expression Analysis

## Question
How can we use machine learning to analyze gene expression data to classify different types of cancer?

## Solution

### Step 1: Data Preparation
We will use the `pandas` library to read and preprocess a gene expression dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression_data.csv')

# Inspect the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Separate features and labels
X = data.drop('label', axis=1)  # gene expression levels
y = data['label']  # cancer types
```

### Step 2: Data Split
We'll split the data into training and test sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn`.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into a training set and a test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 3: Feature Scaling
We will scale the features to improve model performance.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 4: Model Training
We will use a Random Forest classifier for the classification task.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Instantiate the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

### Step 5: Model Evaluation
We will evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Display confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Confusion Matrix:\n{conf_matrix}')
```

### Step 6: Feature Importance
We can analyze which genes are most important for classification.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Get feature importance
features = X.columns
importances = model.feature_importances_

# Create a DataFrame for visualization
importance_df = pd.DataFrame({'Gene': features, 'Importance': importances})
importance_df = importance_df.sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)

# Plot the importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Importance', y='Gene', data=importance_df.head(10))
plt.title('Top 10 Important Genes for Classification')
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion
This tutorial demonstrates how to apply machine learning for classifying cancer types using gene expression data. The Random Forest model allows us to identify key genes influencing cancer classification, providing insights valuable for bioinformatics research.
