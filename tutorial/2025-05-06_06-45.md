# Question
How can we use a machine learning model to predict the biological activity of compounds based on their molecular features in bioinformatics?

# Solution

### Overview
In this tutorial, we will build a machine learning model using Python to predict the biological activity of compounds. We will use the `scikit-learn` library for modeling and `pandas` for data manipulation. We will also visualize the results with `matplotlib`.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset
For this example, we will use a hypothetical dataset of compounds with their respective features and biological activities.

```python
# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('compounds_dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())
```

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
In this step, we will handle missing values and split the data into features and target variable.

```python
# Handling missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Define features and target variable
X = df.drop(columns=['activity'])  # Assuming 'activity' is the target variable
y = df['activity']
```

### Step 4: Split the Data
We will split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Train the Model
We will use a Random Forest Regressor for our prediction model.

```python
# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Make Predictions
Now we will use the model to make predictions on the test set.

```python
# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model
We will evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error and R² score.

```python
# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R² Score: {r2}")
```

### Step 8: Visualize the Results
Finally, we will plot the actual vs predicted values.

```python
# Plotting
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.xlabel('Actual Activity')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Activity')
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Activity')
plt.plot([y.min(), y.max()], [y.min(), y.max()], 'k--', lw=2)
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we created a simple machine learning model to predict the biological activity of compounds using Python. You can expand upon this project by using more advanced models, tuning hyperparameters, or utilizing larger datasets for better predictions.
