# Question
How can we use Python to identify potential drug targets in a given protein sequence using bioinformatics techniques?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will utilize protein sequence data and bioinformatics libraries in Python to identify potential drug targets. We will use the `Biopython` library to manipulate protein data and perform sequence alignment. Additionally, we will use the `requests` library to access external databases for enrichment analysis.

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Ensure you have `Biopython` and `requests` installed. You can do this via pip:

```bash
pip install biopython requests
```

## Step 2: Fetch Protein Sequence

Let's fetch a protein sequence using the UniProt database. 

```python
import requests

def fetch_protein_sequence(protein_id):
    url = f"https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/{protein_id}.fasta"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        fasta_sequence = response.text.strip().split('\n')[1:]  # Skip the header
        return ''.join(fasta_sequence)
    else:
        print("Error fetching the protein sequence.")
        return None

# Example protein: TP53
protein_id = "P04637"
protein_sequence = fetch_protein_sequence(protein_id)
print(f"Protein Sequence for {protein_id}:\n{protein_sequence}")
```

## Step 3: Sequence Alignment

Next, we will perform a simple pairwise alignment using `Biopython`. This helps us identify conserved regions which are potential drug targets.

```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

def align_sequences(seq1, seq2):
    alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)
    return alignments

# Example: align with a known drug target protein
known_target_sequence = "MSEQNNTEMTFQIQRIYTKDISFEAPNAPHAL"
alignment_results = align_sequences(protein_sequence, known_target_sequence)

for alignment in alignment_results:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

## Step 4: Identify Potential Drug Targets

To identify potential drug targets, we can analyze the alignment results and look for regions with high conservation and specific motifs or functional signatures.

```python
def find_potential_targets(alignments):
    for alignment in alignments:
        score = alignment[2]  # Similarity score from the alignment
        if score > len(protein_sequence) * 0.5:  # More than 50% similarity
            print("Potential Drug Target Region:")
            print(alignment[0])  # Print the aligned portion of the first sequence
            print(alignment[1])  # Print the aligned portion of the second sequence
            print("Score:", score)

find_potential_targets(alignment_results)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have successfully fetched a protein sequence from UniProt, applied sequence alignment techniques, and identified potential drug target regions. This is a foundational approach in bioinformatics and can be expanded with more sophisticated analysis and larger datasets.
