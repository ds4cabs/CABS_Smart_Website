# Question: How can we analyze DNA sequences for gene variant discovery using Python?

## Solution

We can use the Biopython library to analyze DNA sequences and identify gene variants. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to:
1. Fetch a DNA sequence from an online database (e.g., NCBI).
2. Perform a basic analysis to find gene variants.
3. Visualize the results.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install biopython matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Fetch DNA Sequence Using Biopython

```python
from Bio import Entrez, SeqIO

# Set up Entrez email
Entrez.email = "your_email@example.com"

# Fetch the DNA sequence from NCBI
def fetch_sequence(accession):
    handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id=accession, rettype="gb", retmode="text")
    record = SeqIO.read(handle, "genbank")
    handle.close()
    return record

# Example accession number
accession_number = "NM_001301717"
dna_sequence = fetch_sequence(accession_number)
print(dna_sequence.seq)
```

### Step 3: Analyze Gene Variants

We will define a simple function to identify potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

```python
def find_snps(sequence):
    snps = []
    for i in range(len(sequence)-1):
        if sequence[i] != sequence[i+1]:
            snps.append((i, sequence[i], sequence[i+1]))
    return snps

snps = find_snps(dna_sequence.seq)
print(f"Found {len(snps)} SNPs: {snps}")
```

### Step 4: Visualize Results

We'll plot the positions of the identified SNPs using `matplotlib`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# SNP positions and their variants
positions = [index for index, _, _ in snps]
variants = [variant for _, _, variant in snps]

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.scatter(positions, [1]*len(positions), c='red', label='SNPs', marker='|')
plt.yticks([])
plt.title('SNP Positions in DNA Sequence')
plt.xlabel('Position in Sequence')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to fetch a DNA sequence, identify SNPs, and visualize the results using Python. This analysis can be a crucial step in understanding genetic variation and its implications in bioinformatics and genomics.
