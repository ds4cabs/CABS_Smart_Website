# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic data and identify variations using the Biopython library?

# Solution

## Overview
In this tutorial, we will analyze genomic data in a FASTA file format and identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Biopython library. 

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the Biopython library. You can install Biopython using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from collections import defaultdict
```

### Step 2: Load Genomic Data

Assume you have a FASTA file named `genomic_data.fasta`.

```python
# Change this to your FASTA file path
fasta_file = "genomic_data.fasta"

# Load sequences from the FASTA file
sequences = []
for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
    sequences.append(record.seq)
```

### Step 3: Identify SNPs

We'll define a function that compares sequences to identify SNPs.

```python
def find_snps(sequences):
    # Using a defaultdict to store SNPs
    snps = defaultdict(list)

    # Compare sequences pairwise
    for i in range(len(sequences) - 1):
        seq1 = sequences[i]
        seq2 = sequences[i + 1]
        for pos in range(len(seq1)):
            if seq1[pos] != seq2[pos]:
                snps[pos].append((seq1[pos], seq2[pos]))

    return snps
```

### Step 4: Execute SNP Detection

```python
snps = find_snps(sequences)

print("Identified SNPs:")
for position, variations in snps.items():
    print(f"Position {position}: {variations}")
```

### Step 5: Saving SNPs to a File

You can save the identified SNPs to a text file for further analysis.

```python
with open("snps_output.txt", "w") as f:
    for position, variations in snps.items():
        f.write(f"Position {position}: {variations}\n")
```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to use Python and the Biopython library to analyze genomic data and identify SNPs. You can extend this framework to incorporate more complex analyses, such as statistical assessments of SNP significance.
