# Question: How can we use Python to analyze DNA sequences for identifying mutations?

## Solution:

In this tutorial, we will analyze DNA sequences to detect mutations using Python. We will compare two DNA sequences: a reference sequence and a mutant sequence. The code will detect and highlight the positions of mutations.

### Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed. We will use libraries such as `pandas` for data handling and `Bio` from Biopython for bioinformatics tasks. 

Install the necessary libraries if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pandas biopython
```

### Code

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from Bio import SeqIO
import pandas as pd

# Function to find mutations
def find_mutations(reference_seq, mutant_seq):
    mutations = []
    for i in range(len(reference_seq)):
        if reference_seq[i] != mutant_seq[i]:
            mutations.append((i+1, reference_seq[i], mutant_seq[i]))  # +1 to make it 1-based index
    return mutations

# Load sequences from FASTA files
def load_sequences(reference_file, mutant_file):
    reference = SeqIO.read(reference_file, "fasta").seq
    mutant = SeqIO.read(mutant_file, "fasta").seq
    return reference, mutant

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    reference_file = "reference_sequence.fasta"  # Change your file path
    mutant_file = "mutant_sequence.fasta"         # Change your file path

    # Load sequences
    reference_seq, mutant_seq = load_sequences(reference_file, mutant_file)

    # Find mutations
    mutations = find_mutations(reference_seq, mutant_seq)

    # Create a DataFrame to display mutations
    mutations_df = pd.DataFrame(mutations, columns=['Position', 'Reference', 'Mutant'])
    
    # Print the mutations DataFrame
    print("Mutations found:")
    print(mutations_df)
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Libraries**: We import Biopython for handling Bioinformatics data and Pandas for data manipulation.

2. **Function `find_mutations`**:
   - This function takes two sequences and compares them.
   - It returns a list of mutations with their positions and nucleotide differences.

3. **Function `load_sequences`**:
   - Reads sequences from FASTA files.
   - Returns the sequences as `Bio.Seq` objects.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - Load your reference and mutant DNA sequences.
   - Call the mutation-finding function and store results in a DataFrame for easy visualization.

### Usage

1. Prepare your DNA sequences in FASTA format and save as `reference_sequence.fasta` and `mutant_sequence.fasta`.
2. Run the script to identify mutations between the two sequences.

This script can serve as a basic framework for more intricate bioinformatics analyses involving DNA sequence alignment and mutation detection.
