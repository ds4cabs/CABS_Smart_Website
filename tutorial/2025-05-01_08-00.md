### Question
How can we use Python to perform advanced sequence alignment in bioinformatics?

### Solution

Python provides powerful libraries to handle biological data, and one of the most popular libraries for sequence alignment is Biopython. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to perform a pairwise sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

#### Installation

Make sure you have Biopython installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

#### Code Example

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Define the sequences
seq1 = "ACGTAG"
seq2 = "ACGTTAG"

# Perform pairwise alignment using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)

# Print the alignments
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

#### Explanation of the Code

- We import the necessary functions from Biopython.
- We define two sequences `seq1` and `seq2`.
- We use the `align.globalxx` function for global alignment with no gap penalties.
- Finally, we iterate through the alignments and print them in a formatted way.

#### Output

The output will display the aligned sequences with their scores and start/end positions. Expect an output similar to:

```
  ACGTA-G
  ||| |||
  ACGT-TAG
  Score=8
```

### Conclusion

This simple example demonstrates how to use Python and Biopython for advanced sequence alignment in bioinformatics. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is widely used for global alignment of protein or nucleotide sequences.
