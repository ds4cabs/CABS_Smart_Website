# How can we use Python for sequence alignment in bioinformatics?

In bioinformatics, sequence alignment is a fundamental method for comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. Here, we will implement an advanced sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have `Biopython` installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Implementing the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm

Here's a simple implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm in Python for global sequence alignment.

```python
import numpy as np

# Scoring parameters
MATCH_SCORE = 1
MISMATCH_SCORE = -1
GAP_SCORE = -2

def create_score_matrix(seq1, seq2):
    # Create score matrix
    n = len(seq1) + 1
    m = len(seq2) + 1
    score_matrix = np.zeros((n, m))

    # Initialize the first row and column
    for i in range(n):
        score_matrix[i][0] = i * GAP_SCORE
    for j in range(m):
        score_matrix[0][j] = j * GAP_SCORE

    # Fill the score matrix
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m):
            match = score_matrix[i-1][j-1] + (MATCH_SCORE if seq1[i-1] == seq2[j-1] else MISMATCH_SCORE)
            delete = score_matrix[i-1][j] + GAP_SCORE
            insert = score_matrix[i][j-1] + GAP_SCORE
            score_matrix[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)

    return score_matrix

def traceback(score_matrix, seq1, seq2):
    alignment1, alignment2 = "", ""
    i, j = score_matrix.shape[0] - 1, score_matrix.shape[1] - 1

    while i > 0 or j > 0:
        current_score = score_matrix[i][j]
        if i > 0 and j > 0 and (current_score == score_matrix[i-1][j-1] + (MATCH_SCORE if seq1[i-1] == seq2[j-1] else MISMATCH_SCORE)):
            alignment1 += seq1[i-1]
            alignment2 += seq2[j-1]
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif i > 0 and current_score == score_matrix[i-1][j] + GAP_SCORE:
            alignment1 += seq1[i-1]
            alignment2 += "-"
            i -= 1
        else:
            alignment1 += "-"
            alignment2 += seq2[j-1]
            j -= 1

    return alignment1[::-1], alignment2[::-1]

def needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2):
    score_matrix = create_score_matrix(seq1, seq2)
    alignment1, alignment2 = traceback(score_matrix, seq1, seq2)
    
    return alignment1, alignment2, score_matrix[-1][-1]

# Example usage
seq1 = "AGCTG"
seq2 = "AGCT"
alignment1, alignment2, score = needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2)

print("Alignment:")
print(alignment1)
print(alignment2)
print("Alignment Score:", score)
```

### Explanation

1. **Score Matrix Creation**: A matrix is initialized based on the lengths of the sequences with gap penalties.
2. **Matrix Filling**: Each cell is populated with scores based on match/mismatch and gap penalties.
3. **Traceback**: Starting from the bottom-right of the matrix, alignments are built back to the start to yield the optimal match.
4. **Output**: The aligned sequences and their score are printed.

### Conclusion

This implementation shows how Python can be used effectively in bioinformatics for sequence alignment, a crucial task in genomics and proteomics. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm not only allows for aligned sequences but also provides a score to evaluate the quality of the alignment.
