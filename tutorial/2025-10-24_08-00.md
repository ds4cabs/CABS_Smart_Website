# Question
How can we implement a neural network for predicting protein secondary structure using Python and TensorFlow?

# Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't done so yet.

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Load Data
Assuming you have a dataset in a FASTA format, we will load and preprocess it.

```python
def load_data(filepath):
    sequences = []
    labels = []
    
    for record in SeqIO.parse(filepath, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
        # Assume labels are embedded in sequence descriptions or another file
        # For example, record.id might refer to some label
        labels.append(record.id.split('|')[1])  # Example: Adjust based on your data structure
    
    return sequences, labels

sequences, labels = load_data("protein_sequences.fasta")
```

### Step 4: Encode Sequences
We need to convert protein sequences into numerical format.

```python
def encode_sequences(sequences):
    amino_acids = 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'  # Represented in single-letter codes
    aa_dict = {aa: idx for idx, aa in enumerate(amino_acids)}
    
    encoded = []
    for seq in sequences:
        encoded_seq = [aa_dict[aa] for aa in seq if aa in aa_dict]
        encoded.append(encoded_seq)
    
    return np.array(encoded)

encoded_sequences = encode_sequences(sequences)
```

### Step 5: Prepare Dataset
Split into training and test sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    encoded_sequences, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Padding sequences to the same length
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

max_length = max(len(seq) for seq in X_train)
X_train = pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')
X_test = pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')
```

### Step 6: Build the Neural Network Model

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Embedding(input_dim=len(amino_acids), output_dim=64, input_length=max_length),
    layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(len(set(labels)), activation='softmax')  # Output layer based on number of classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Step 7: Train the Model

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

### Step 8: Evaluate the Model

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

### Step 9: Make Predictions

```python
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
```
