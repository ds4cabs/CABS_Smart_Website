# Question
How can we use Python to analyze DNA sequences and identify potential gene mutations?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python to analyze DNA sequences from a FASTA file, identify mutations, and visualize the results. We will utilize libraries like Biopython for biological data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install biopython matplotlib
```

## Step 2: Prepare Your DNA Sequence Data

Create a file named `sequences.fasta` and populate it with the following sample DNA sequences:

```
>sequence1
AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCT
>sequence2
AGCTCGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCT
```

## Step 3: Load and Analyze the Sequences

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load sequences from the FASTA file
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(record.seq)
    return sequences

# Identify mutations between two sequences
def identify_mutations(seq1, seq2):
    mutations = []
    for i in range(len(seq1)):
        if seq1[i] != seq2[i]:
            mutations.append((i, seq1[i], seq2[i]))
    return mutations

# Visualization of mutations
def visualize_mutations(mutations):
    positions = [m[0] for m in mutations]
    mutation_count = len(mutations)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.bar(positions, [1]*mutation_count, color='red')
    plt.xlabel('Position')
    plt.ylabel('Mutation Count')
    plt.title(f'Gene Mutations Found: {mutation_count}')
    plt.xticks(positions)
    plt.show()

# Main function to run the analysis
def main():
    sequences = load_sequences("sequences.fasta")
    mutations = identify_mutations(sequences[0], sequences[1])
    
    print("Mutations found at positions:", mutations)
    visualize_mutations(mutations)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Step 4: Execute the Script

Run the Python script.

```bash
python analyze_dna.py
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to analyze DNA sequences for mutations using Python. The results include a list of mutations and a visual representation of mutation positions. You can expand upon this by integrating more complex analysis and larger datasets as needed.
