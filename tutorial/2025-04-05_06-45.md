# Tutorial: Advanced AI in Bioinformatics - Gene Expression Analysis

## Question
How can we use AI techniques to predict gene expression levels from DNA sequences using Python?

## Solution

### Step 1: Environment Setup
Make sure to install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas sklearn tensorflow
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
```

### Step 3: Data Preparation
Create a synthetic dataset simulating DNA sequences and corresponding gene expression levels.
```python
# Generate synthetic data
def generate_synthetic_data(num_samples):
    np.random.seed(42)
    # Simulating DNA sequences as one-hot encoded vectors
    sequences = np.random.randint(2, size=(num_samples, 50, 4))  # 50 base pairs and 4 for A, T, C, G
    expressions = np.random.rand(num_samples) * 100  # Gene expression levels between 0-100
    return sequences, expressions

# Create dataset
num_samples = 1000
X, y = generate_synthetic_data(num_samples)
```

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then reshape data for the neural network.
```python
# Reshape data for input into LSTM layers
X = X.reshape(num_samples, 50 * 4)  # Flatten the DNA sequences

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Feature Scaling
Standardize the features for better performance.
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 6: Build the Neural Network
Create a neural network model to predict gene expression levels.
```python
# Build the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(128, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='linear'))  # Output layer for regression

model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')
```

### Step 7: Train the Model
Fit the model on the training data.
```python
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2, verbose=1)
```

### Step 8: Evaluate the Model
Assess the performance on the test set.
```python
# Evaluate the model
loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Loss: {loss}")
```

### Step 9: Make Predictions
Use the model to make predictions on new data.
```python
# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Predicted Gene Expression Levels:", predictions.flatten())
```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to create a simple AI model using Python to predict gene expression levels from synthetic DNA sequences. Adjust the architecture and parameters as needed to improve performance based on actual biological data for more accurate predictions.
