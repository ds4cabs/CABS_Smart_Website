# Question

How can we use Python to analyze genomic data and implement a basic AI model for predicting gene expression levels?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will utilize Python libraries to analyze genomic data, preprocess it, and build a simple machine learning model that predicts gene expression levels based on gene features.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Step 1: Data Preparation

First, let's import the necessary libraries and load our genomic data.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load genomic dataset
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression_data.csv')  # Make sure this CSV file exists.
print(data.head())
```

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values and separating features and labels.

```python
# Handle missing values
data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)

# Separate features and labels
X = data.drop('gene_expression', axis=1)  # Features
y = data['gene_expression']  # Target variable
```

## Step 3: Train-Test Split

Split the data into training and testing sets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 4: Build a Machine Learning Model

Here, we will use a Random Forest Regressor for predicting gene expression levels.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 5: Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using the test set.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
print(f'R^2 Score: {r2}')
```

## Step 6: Visualize Predictions

Finally, let's visualize the predicted versus actual gene expression levels.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.scatterplot(x=y_test, y=y_pred)
plt.xlabel('Actual Gene Expression')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Gene Expression')
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Gene Expression Levels')
plt.plot([y.min(), y.max()], [y.min(), y.max()], 'r--')  # Reference line
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to analyze genomic data and build a predictive model for gene expression levels using Python. This is just a foundational step towards more advanced AI applications in bioinformatics.
