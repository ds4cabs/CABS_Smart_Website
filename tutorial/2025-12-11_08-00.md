# Tutorial: Predicting Protein Secondary Structure using Python and Biopython

## Question:
How can we predict the secondary structure of a protein sequence using machine learning in Python with Biopython?

## Solution:

### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install biopython scikit-learn numpy
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
from Bio import SeqIO
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
```

### Step 2: Load Protein Data
We'll use a sample dataset in FASTA format containing protein sequences and their corresponding secondary structures.

```python
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    labels = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
        labels.append(record.description.split('|')[1])  # Assume the label is in the description
    return sequences, labels

file_path = 'protein_data.fasta'
sequences, labels = load_sequences(file_path)
```

### Step 3: Feature Engineering
Convert sequences into features (e.g., using one-hot encoding).

```python
def one_hot_encode(seq):
    amino_acids = 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'
    encoding = np.zeros((len(seq), len(amino_acids)), dtype=int)
    for i, aa in enumerate(seq):
        if aa in amino_acids:
            encoding[i, amino_acids.index(aa)] = 1
    return encoding.flatten()

X = np.array([one_hot_encode(seq) for seq in sequences])
y = np.array(labels)
```

### Step 4: Split Data into Training and Test Sets
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Train the Model
Using a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
```python
classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Make Predictions
```python
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model
```python
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Conclusion
This tutorial demonstrated how to predict protein secondary structures from sequences using machine learning in Python. With further refinement and a more extensive dataset, model performance can improve significantly.
