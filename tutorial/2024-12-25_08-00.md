# How can we use Python for sequence alignment in Bioinformatics?

## Introduction
Sequence alignment is a fundamental skill in bioinformatics, allowing us to compare DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to identify similarities and differences that might suggest functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships. In this tutorial, we'll leverage the `Biopython` library to perform sequence alignment.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and Biopython installed. You can install Biopython using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Step-by-step Tutorial

### Question
How can we perform sequence alignments using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm?

### Solution

```python
# Import the necessary modules from Biopython
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Define the sequences to align
sequence1 = "ACGTGAC"
sequence2 = "ACGTA"

# Perform the alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(sequence1, sequence2)

# Print all alignments
for alignment in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Explanation
- **Importing Modules**: We import necessary functions from Biopython to perform the alignment.
- **Defining Sequences**: Two sequences, `sequence1` and `sequence2`, are defined for alignment.
- **Performing Alignment**: We use `pairwise2.align.globalxx()` which implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment.
- **Printing Results**: The alignments are printed in a human-readable format using `format_alignment`.

### Output
The output of the code will display potential alignments, including score and alignment details showing gaps in the sequences where necessary.

## Conclusion
This simple yet powerful approach allows you to align sequences efficiently, which is a crucial step in many bioinformatics analyses, aiding in tasks such as phylogenetics, functional annotation, and much more.
