# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and identify potential mutations associated with a specific disease?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we'll use Python to analyze genomic sequences stored in a FASTA file and identify mutations that may be relevant to a specific disease.

## Required Libraries
Make sure to install the required libraries first:
```bash
pip install biopython pandas
```

## Step 1: Load Genomic Data
We will use Biopython to read a FASTA file containing the genomic sequences.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

# Load the genomic data
def load_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

fasta_file = "genomic_sequences.fasta"
sequences = load_sequences(fasta_file)
```

## Step 2: Define Potential Mutations
Assume we have a list of known mutations related to a specific disease. We can define these mutations as a dictionary, where keys are positions and values are the expected nucleotide changes.

```python
# Example mutations dictionary: {position: (expected, actual)}
mutations = {
    100: ('A', 'G'),
    250: ('C', 'T'),
    500: ('T', 'A')
}
```

## Step 3: Analyze Sequences for Mutations
Now we will analyze each sequence to check for these mutations.

```python
def analyze_mutations(sequences, mutations):
    results = {}
    for seq_id, seq in sequences.items():
        detected_mutations = []
        for position, (expected, actual) in mutations.items():
            if position - 1 < len(seq) and seq[position - 1] != expected:
                detected_mutations.append((position, seq[position - 1], expected))
        if detected_mutations:
            results[seq_id] = detected_mutations
    return results

mutation_results = analyze_mutations(sequences, mutations)
print(mutation_results)
```

## Step 4: Output Results
The results will show the sequences with detected mutations.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame for better visualization
def output_results(results):
    data = []
    for seq_id, mutations in results.items():
        for pos, actual, expected in mutations:
            data.append({"Sequence ID": seq_id, "Position": pos, "Actual": actual, "Expected": expected})
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    df.to_csv("mutation_analysis_results.csv", index=False)
    print("Results saved to mutation_analysis_results.csv")

output_results(mutation_results)
```

## Conclusion
With this code, we can efficiently analyze genomic sequences to identify potential mutations associated with a specific disease. The output is saved in a CSV file for further analysis.
