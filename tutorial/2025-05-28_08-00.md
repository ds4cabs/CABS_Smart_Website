# Question: How can we use Python to analyze gene expression data to identify differentially expressed genes?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we'll use Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy to analyze gene expression data and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy statsmodels
```

### Step 2: Import Required Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
import statsmodels.api as sm
```

### Step 3: Load Gene Expression Data

Assuming you have a CSV file containing gene expression data with samples as columns and genes as rows. The first column is 'Gene', followed by expression values for two conditions.

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

### Step 4: Preprocessing Data

Separate the data into two groups based on conditions (e.g., control and treatment).

```python
# Assuming columns are structured as Gene, Control_1, Control_2, Treatment_1, Treatment_2
control_columns = data.columns[1:3]  # Adjust according to your dataset
treatment_columns = data.columns[3:5]

# Control and Treatment data
control_data = data[control_columns]
treatment_data = data[treatment_columns]
```

### Step 5: Conduct Statistical Analysis

We will use an independent t-test to find DEGs.

```python
# Function to perform t-test
def perform_ttest(control, treatment):
    return stats.ttest_ind(control, treatment, equal_var=False)

# Store results
results = []

for index, row in data.iterrows():
    control_mean = row[control_columns].mean()
    treatment_mean = row[treatment_columns].mean()
    
    t_stat, p_value = perform_ttest(row[control_columns], row[treatment_columns])
    
    results.append({
        'Gene': row['Gene'],
        'Control Mean': control_mean,
        'Treatment Mean': treatment_mean,
        'T-statistic': t_stat,
        'P-value': p_value
    })

# Create a DataFrame of results
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
```

### Step 6: Adjust P-values for Multiple Testing

Use the Benjamini-Hochberg method to adjust for multiple comparisons.

```python
# Adjusting p-values
results_df['Adjusted P-value'] = sm.stats.multipletests(results_df['P-value'], method='fdr_by')[1]
```

### Step 7: Identify Differently Expressed Genes

Define a significance threshold and filter the DEGs.

```python
# Define threshold
alpha = 0.05  # Significance level

# Filtering DEGs
DEGs = results_df[results_df['Adjusted P-value'] < alpha]

# Display DEGs
print(DEGs)
```

### Step 8: Save Results to CSV

```python
# Save the DEG results to a CSV file
DEGs.to_csv('differentially_expressed_genes.csv', index=False)
```

### Conclusion

This notebook discusses how to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using gene expression data and statistical methods. You can further enhance this analysis by visualizing the results using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for better insights.
