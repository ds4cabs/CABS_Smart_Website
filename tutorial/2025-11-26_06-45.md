# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and perform basic motif detection in bioinformatics?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python to analyze genomic sequences to detect specific motifs (patterns) within them. We will use the `Biopython` library, which is widely used for biological computation. 

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system
- `Biopython` library installed
- Basic understanding of DNA sequences

You can install `Biopython` using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
```

## Step 2: Load a Genomic Sequence

For this tutorial, we will create a simple FASTA file called `example.fasta` containing a DNA sequence.

```fasta
>example_sequence
ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCATCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
```

Now, we will read this sequence using `Bio.SeqIO`.

```python
def read_sequence(file_path):
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        return record.seq

sequence = read_sequence("example.fasta")
print(f"Loaded Sequence: {sequence}")
```

## Step 3: Calculate GC Content

Calculating the GC content is useful for understanding the composition of the sequence.

```python
gc_content = GC(sequence)
print(f"GC Content: {gc_content:.2f}%")
```

## Step 4: Motif Detection

We will write a function to search for a specific motif within the sequence.

```python
def find_motif(sequence, motif):
    start_positions = []
    pos = sequence.find(motif)
    while pos != -1:
        start_positions.append(pos)
        pos = sequence.find(motif, pos + 1)
    return start_positions

motif = "CTAG"
positions = find_motif(sequence, motif)
print(f"Motif '{motif}' found at positions: {positions}")
```

## Step 5: Putting It All Together

Here is the complete code:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC

def read_sequence(file_path):
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        return record.seq

def find_motif(sequence, motif):
    start_positions = []
    pos = sequence.find(motif)
    while pos != -1:
        start_positions.append(pos)
        pos = sequence.find(motif, pos + 1)
    return start_positions

# Load sequence
sequence = read_sequence("example.fasta")
print(f"Loaded Sequence: {sequence}")

# Calculate GC content
gc_content = GC(sequence)
print(f"GC Content: {gc_content:.2f}%")

# Motif detection
motif = "CTAG"
positions = find_motif(sequence, motif)
print(f"Motif '{motif}' found at positions: {positions}")
```

## Conclusion

Through this simple example, we demonstrated how to read genomic sequences, calculate GC content, and detect motifs using Python and the Biopython library. This foundational approach can be extended to more complex analyses in bioinformatics.
