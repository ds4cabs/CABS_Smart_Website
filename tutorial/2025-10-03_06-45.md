# Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Predicting Protein Structures

## Question
How can we utilize deep learning to predict protein structures from their amino acid sequences?

## Solution

We'll implement a simplified version of a deep learning model using Python with the TensorFlow framework. The model will predict secondary structures of proteins based on their sequences.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow biopython numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset
Here, we will assume that we have a dataset where each protein sequence corresponds to its secondary structure labels (e.g., 'H' for helix, 'E' for sheet, 'C' for coil).

```python
def load_data(file_path):
    sequences = []
    labels = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
        labels.append(str(record.description))
    return sequences, labels

sequences, labels = load_data('protein_sequences.fasta')
```

### Step 3: Preprocess the Data
Convert sequences to numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding) and split the dataset into training and testing.
```python
def encode_sequences(sequences):
    amino_acids = 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'
    encoding = {aa: i for i, aa in enumerate(amino_acids)}
    encoded = []
    for seq in sequences:
        encoded_seq = np.zeros((len(seq), len(amino_acids)))
        for j, aa in enumerate(seq):
            encoded_seq[j, encoding[aa]] = 1
        encoded.append(encoded_seq)
    return np.array(encoded)

X = encode_sequences(sequences)
y = np.array(labels)  # Assuming labels are already in numerical format

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 4: Build the Model
We will create a simple LSTM model for our sequence data.
```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(len(set(y)), activation='softmax')  # Output layer for multi-class classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Step 5: Train the Model
```python
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model
```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```

### Step 7: Make Predictions
To predict the secondary structure of a new protein sequence:
```python
def predict_structure(sequence):
    encoded_seq = encode_sequences([sequence])
    prediction = model.predict(encoded_seq)
    return np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)

new_sequence = "ACDEFGHIKLM"
predicted_structure = predict_structure(new_sequence)
print(f'Predicted Structure: {predicted_structure}')
```

### Conclusion
You've learned how to build a simple AI model to predict protein secondary structures from sequences using deep learning. Adjustments in model architecture and further optimizations can lead to enhanced performance in real-world applications.
