## Question

How can we leverage Python to perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics for DNA sequences using the Biopython library?

## Solution

To perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics, we can utilize the Biopython library, which provides tools for biological computation.

### Step 1: Install Biopython

If you haven't installed Biopython yet, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Required Modules

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Align import PairwiseAligner
```

### Step 3: Define DNA Sequences

```python
# Define the DNA sequences
seq1 = "ATCGTACGATCG"
seq2 = "ATCGTACGATCC"
```

### Step 4: Create an Instance of PairwiseAligner

```python
# Create a pairwise aligner instance
aligner = PairwiseAligner()
```

### Step 5: Perform Alignment

```python
# Perform alignment
alignment = aligner.align(seq1, seq2)

# Print the alignment score
print("Alignment Score:", alignment.score)
```

### Step 6: Display the Alignment

```python
# Print the aligned sequences
for aln in alignment:
    print("Aligned Sequences:")
    print(aln)
```

### Full Code

Here’s the complete code block to run:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Align import PairwiseAligner

# Define the DNA sequences
seq1 = "ATCGTACGATCG"
seq2 = "ATCGTACGATCC"

# Create a pairwise aligner instance
aligner = PairwiseAligner()

# Perform alignment
alignment = aligner.align(seq1, seq2)

# Print the alignment score
print("Alignment Score:", alignment.score)

# Print the aligned sequences
for aln in alignment:
    print("Aligned Sequences:")
    print(aln)
```

### Conclusion

This script provides an efficient way to align two DNA sequences using Python and Biopython’s PairwiseAligner tool. The score will give insight into the similarity between the sequences, allowing for further bioinformatics analysis.
