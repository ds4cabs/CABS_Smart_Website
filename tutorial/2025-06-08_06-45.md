# Question
How can we use Python to perform genomic sequence analysis in bioinformatics, specifically to identify nucleotide motifs within a given DNA sequence?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will use Python to identify nucleotide motifs in a DNA sequence using regular expressions. We will utilize the `re` library for pattern matching. 

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python
- Install Python (3.x) and required libraries if not already installed.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Make sure you have the `Bio` package from Biopython. You can install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install biopython
   ```

2. **Import Libraries**
   ```python
   import re
   from Bio.Seq import Seq
   ```

3. **Define the DNA Sequence**
   ```python
   # Sample DNA sequence
   dna_sequence = Seq("AGCTGATCGATCGTACGATCGTTAGCTAGTGCTAGCTAGCTA")
   ```

4. **Define the Motif to Search For**
   ```python
   # Define the motif (e.g., 'GCT')
   motif = "GCT" 
   ```

5. **Compile the Motif Pattern**
   ```python
   # Compile the regex pattern
   pattern = re.compile(motif)
   ```

6. **Find All Matches**
   ```python
   # Find all occurrences of the motif in the DNA sequence
   matches = pattern.finditer(str(dna_sequence))
   ```

7. **Display Results**
   ```python
   # Print positions of each match
   for match in matches:
       print(f"Motif found at position: {match.start()}")
   ```

### Complete Code
```python
import re
from Bio.Seq import Seq

# Sample DNA sequence
dna_sequence = Seq("AGCTGATCGATCGTACGATCGTTAGCTAGTGCTAGCTAGCTA")

# Define the motif (e.g., 'GCT')
motif = "GCT"

# Compile the regex pattern
pattern = re.compile(motif)

# Find all occurrences of the motif in the DNA sequence
matches = pattern.finditer(str(dna_sequence))

# Print positions of each match
for match in matches:
    print(f"Motif found at position: {match.start()}")
```

### Conclusion
This Python script efficiently identifies and reports the positions of specific nucleotide motifs in a DNA sequence using regular expressions. You can modify the `dna_sequence` and `motif` variables to analyze different sequences and motifs as needed.
