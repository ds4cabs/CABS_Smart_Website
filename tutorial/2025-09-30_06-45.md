# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and identify potential mutations associated with diseases?

# Solution

## Step 1: Setup

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install biopython pandas matplotlib
```

## Step 2: Load Genomic Data

We'll use the Biopython library to load and process genomic sequences. For this example, we will create a simple dataset as a FASTA file.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

# Example FASTA file path
fasta_file = "genome_sequences.fasta"

# Load sequences
sequences = list(SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"))
print(f"Loaded {len(sequences)} sequences.")
```

## Step 3: Define a Mutation Detection Function

We can define a function to identify specific mutations in the sequences:

```python
def detect_mutations(sequences, reference_sequence, mutation_threshold=1):
    mutations = {}
    for seq_record in sequences:
        variant_count = sum(1 for a, b in zip(reference_sequence, str(seq_record.seq)) if a != b)
        if variant_count >= mutation_threshold:
            mutations[seq_record.id] = variant_count
    return mutations
```

## Step 4: Usage Example

Assuming you have a reference sequence for comparison:

```python
# Example reference sequence (usually loaded from a file or database)
reference_sequence = "ACTGACTGAGTCAGTCA"

# Detect mutations in the loaded sequences
mutations = detect_mutations(sequences, reference_sequence)
print("Detected Mutations:")
for seq_id, count in mutations.items():
    print(f"{seq_id}: {count} mutations")
```

## Step 5: Visualize the Mutations

We can visualize the results using Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Prepare data for plotting
ids = list(mutations.keys())
mutation_counts = list(mutations.values())

# Create bar plot
plt.bar(ids, mutation_counts)
plt.xlabel('Sequence ID')
plt.ylabel('Number of Mutations')
plt.title('Mutation Counts in Genomic Sequences')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a framework to analyze genomic sequences for mutations. You can further enhance this code by integrating real genomic datasets, refining mutation detection algorithms, and incorporating statistical analyses for a more comprehensive bioinformatics study.
