# How to Use Python for Gene Sequence Analysis in Bioinformatics

## Question
How can we analyze gene sequences using Python to identify the GC content (the percentage of nucleotides in a DNA molecule that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C))?

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can use Biopython for handling biological data.

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Define Function to Calculate GC Content

```python
def gc_content(sequence):
    """Calculate the GC content of a given DNA sequence."""
    g_count = sequence.count('G')
    c_count = sequence.count('C')
    total_bases = len(sequence)
    
    gc_percentage = (g_count + c_count) / total_bases * 100
    return gc_percentage
```

### Step 4: Read Sequence Data
Assuming you have a FASTA file named `example.fasta`:

```python
def read_sequences(file_path):
    """Read DNA sequences from a FASTA file."""
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
    return sequences
```

### Step 5: Main Function to Execute Analysis

```python
def main(file_path):
    """Main function to read sequences and calculate their GC content."""
    sequences = read_sequences(file_path)
    
    for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):
        gc_percentage = gc_content(seq)
        print(f"Sequence {i+1}: GC Content = {gc_percentage:.2f}%")
```

### Step 6: Run the Analysis

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main("example.fasta")
```

### Example FASTA File (`example.fasta`)
```
>Seq1
AGCTAGCTGCGATCGAGCTAGCTAGC
>Seq2
CGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG
```

### Running the Script
Execute the script in your command line:

```bash
python gc_analysis.py
```

### Expected Output
```
Sequence 1: GC Content = 50.00%
Sequence 2: GC Content = 66.67%
```
