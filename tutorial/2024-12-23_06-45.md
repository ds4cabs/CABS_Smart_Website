# How Can We Use Advanced AI Techniques for Gene Expression Analysis in Bioinformatics?

Gene expression analysis is fundamental in bioinformatics for understanding the biological processes of organisms. This tutorial demonstrates how to use Python with deep learning frameworks to predict gene expression levels based on various features.

## Solution

### Environment Setup
First, ensure you have the following packages installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
```

### Load Dataset
Assume we have a dataset `gene_expression.csv` with features and target gene expressions.
```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

### Preprocessing Data
Separate features and target variable, then split the data.
```python
# Features and target variable
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```
