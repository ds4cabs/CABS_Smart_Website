# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and identify mutations?

## Solution: Using Biopython for Genomic Analysis

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Biopython installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
```

### Step 2: Load Genomic Sequences

Assuming you have a FASTA file (e.g., `genomes.fasta`), load the sequences as follows:

```python
sequences = list(SeqIO.parse("genomes.fasta", "fasta"))
```

### Step 3: Calculate GC Content

A common analysis is calculating the GC content of the sequences:

```python
for seq_record in sequences:
    seq_gc = GC(seq_record.seq)
    print(f"ID: {seq_record.id}, GC Content: {seq_gc:.2f}%")
```

### Step 4: Identify Mutations

To identify mutations, we can compare two sequences. Assume we have two sequences from the same organism:

```python
# Load the two sequences (assuming they are already in the list)
seq1 = sequences[0].seq
seq2 = sequences[1].seq

# Compare sequences and find mutations
mutations = []
for i, (base1, base2) in enumerate(zip(seq1, seq2)):
    if base1 != base2:
        mutations.append((i, base1, base2))

print("Mutations found:")
for mutation in mutations:
    print(f"Position: {mutation[0]}, Original: {mutation[1]}, Mutated: {mutation[2]}")
```

### Step 5: Visualizing the Mutations

For visualization, we can use Matplotlib to create a simple plot of mutations:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

positions = [m[0] for m in mutations]
original_bases = [m[1] for m in mutations]
mutated_bases = [m[2] for m in mutations]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.scatter(positions, [1]*len(positions), color='red', label='Mutations')
plt.title('Mutation Positions')
plt.xlabel('Position on Sequence')
plt.yticks([])
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial walks you through analyzing genomic sequences in Python using Biopython, calculating GC content, identifying mutations, and visualizing them. Adapt this framework to suit your specific genomics project needs!
