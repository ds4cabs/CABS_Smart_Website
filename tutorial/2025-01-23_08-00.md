# Question

How can we use Python to perform sequence alignment for DNA sequences in bioinformatics?

# Solution

In bioinformatics, sequence alignment is a method for arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity. We will use the `Biopython` library to perform sequence alignment.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed along with `Biopython`. Install it using pip if you haven't:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Code

```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Define two DNA sequences
seq1 = "AGGTAB"
seq2 = "AGGTABD"

# Perform the sequence alignment
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)

# Print the best alignment
print("Best alignment:")
for alignment in alignments[:1]:  # Get the first alignment
    print(format_alignment(*alignment))
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Libraries**: We import necessary functions from Biopython.
2. **Define Sequences**: Two DNA sequences are defined as strings.
3. **Perform Alignment**: The `globalxx` function performs global alignment using a simple scoring method.
4. **Print Results**: The best alignment is printed in a human-readable format.

### Output

The output will display the aligned sequences with matching positions indicated:

```
Best alignment:
AGGTAB
AGGTABD
  |||
```

This basic approach to sequence alignment provides insight into the similarities and differences in genetic sequences, crucial for various bioinformatics applications.
