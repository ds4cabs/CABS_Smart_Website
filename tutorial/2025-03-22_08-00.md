# Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Protein Structure Prediction

## Question
How can we predict protein structures using deep learning techniques in Python?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we'll use a deep learning library called TensorFlow along with Keras to create a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting protein structures based on amino acid sequences. We will focus on the secondary structure prediction problem.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow library
- pandas
- numpy

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy
```

#### Step 2: Data Preparation

For protein structure prediction, we typically use datasets like CB513 or CASP. For this example, let's assume we have a dataset `proteins.csv` containing amino acid sequences and their corresponding secondary structures.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('proteins.csv')

# Example data structure: 
# data.head()
#   sequence                                structure
# 0 "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"                "HHHHHHHHHHHHH"
# 1 "CDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVW"                   "CCCCCCCCCCC"
```

#### Step 3: Preprocessing the Data
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Encoding the amino acid sequences
def encode_sequence(seq):
    return [ord(a) - ord('A') for a in seq]  # Simple conversion for this example

data['encoded_sequence'] = data['sequence'].apply(encode_sequence)

# Padding sequences for uniform input size
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

X = pad_sequences(data['encoded_sequence'].tolist(), padding='post')
y = data['structure'].apply(lambda x: list(x)).tolist()

# One-hot encoding the output
y_encoded = [[ord(s) - ord('A') for s in structure] for structure in y]

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y_encoded, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

#### Step 4: Building the CNN Model
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv1D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))  # Adjust according to the number of classes in your structure

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

#### Step 5: Training the Model
```python
# Reshape input for CNN
X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1)
X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], X_test.shape[1], 1)

model.fit(X_train, np.array(y_train), epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, np.array(y_test)))
```

#### Step 6: Evaluation
```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, np.array(y_test))
print(f'Test Loss: {loss}, Test Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```
