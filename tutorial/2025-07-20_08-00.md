# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic data to identify mutations linked to a specific disease?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will analyze genomic data using Python to identify mutations associated with a specific disease. We will use `pandas` for data manipulation and `biopython` for biological computations. The dataset includes genomic sequences and mutation information.

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
```

### Step 2: Load Genomic Data

Assuming we have a CSV file named `genomic_data.csv` with columns `Gene`, `Mutation`, and `DiseaseAssociation`.

```python
# Load genomic data
genomic_data = pd.read_csv('genomic_data.csv')
print(genomic_data.head())
```

### Step 3: Filter Mutations for a Specific Disease

We will filter mutations associated with a specified disease, e.g., "Cancer".

```python
# Specify the disease
disease_name = 'Cancer'

# Filter data
cancer_mutations = genomic_data[genomic_data['DiseaseAssociation'] == disease_name]
print(cancer_mutations)
```

### Step 4: Analyze Mutation Impact

We can analyze the functional impact of the identified mutations using a hypothetical function `get_mutation_impact`.

```python
def get_mutation_impact(mutation):
    # Placeholder for complex mutation impact analysis
    # In real use, you might call a bioinformatics API or use a database
    impacts = {
        'missense': 'potentially harmful',
        'nonsense': 'likely harmful',
        'silent': 'usually benign'
    }
    return impacts.get(mutation, 'unknown impact')

# Apply the impact analysis
cancer_mutations['Impact'] = cancer_mutations['Mutation'].apply(get_mutation_impact)
print(cancer_mutations[['Gene', 'Mutation', 'Impact']])
```

### Step 5: Visualize the Results 

We can generate a simple bar plot to visualize the distribution of mutation impacts across the filtered mutations.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

impact_counts = cancer_mutations['Impact'].value_counts()
impact_counts.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title(f'Mutation Impact Distribution for {disease_name}')
plt.xlabel('Impact')
plt.ylabel('Number of Mutations')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to filter and analyze genomic data to identify mutations associated with a disease. This basic framework can be expanded with more detailed analysis and functional validation of mutations using advanced bioinformatics tools.
