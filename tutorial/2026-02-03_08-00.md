# Question
How can we use advanced AI techniques to analyze genomic sequences for predicting gene functions in bioinformatics using Python?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will implement a machine learning model to predict gene functions from genomic sequences using Python. We will use the `Biopython` library for handling sequences and `scikit-learn` for building our model.

## Step 1: Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install biopython scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from Bio import SeqIO
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
```

## Step 3: Load Genomic Data

Assume we have a FASTA file `genomes.fasta` and a corresponding CSV file `gene_functions.csv` that contains gene IDs and their functions.

```python
# Load sequences from FASTA file
sequences = {}
for record in SeqIO.parse("genomes.fasta", "fasta"):
    sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)

# Load gene functions into a DataFrame
gene_functions = pd.read_csv("gene_functions.csv")
```

## Step 4: Feature Engineering

We need to convert genomic sequences into numerical feature vectors. A simple approach is to use k-mer frequency.

```python
def kmer_features(sequence, k=3):
    return [sequence[i:i+k] for i in range(len(sequence)-k+1)]

# Extract k-mer features
k = 3
feature_data = []
for gene_id, sequence in sequences.items():
    kmers = kmer_features(sequence, k)
    feature_data.append(pd.Series(kmers).value_counts())

# Create a DataFrame
features_df = pd.DataFrame(feature_data).fillna(0)
features_df['Gene_ID'] = sequences.keys()
```

## Step 5: Prepare Data for Training

Merge features with gene functions.

```python
data = pd.merge(features_df, gene_functions, left_on='Gene_ID', right_on='gene_id')
X = data.drop(['Gene_ID', 'gene_id', 'function'], axis=1)
y = data['function']
```

## Step 6: Split the Dataset

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 7: Build and Train the Model

Using a Random Forest Classifier for gene function prediction.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 8: Evaluate the Model

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
