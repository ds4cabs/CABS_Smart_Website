# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and predict the presence of specific genes using advanced AI techniques?

# Solution

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will use Pythonâ€™s Biopython library along with TensorFlow to create a simple neural network model to predict the presence of a specific gene in DNA sequences.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install biopython tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Step 1: Load Genomic Data

First, we'll load some genomic sequences (fasta format) and their labels indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of a specific gene.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
import pandas as pd

# Load sequences from a .fasta file
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    labels = []  # Assuming the labels are in a separate file or derived somehow
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
        # Assuming that 'label' is available. Replace '0 or 1' with actual condition
        labels.append(1 if "specific_gene" in record.id else 0)
    return sequences, labels

sequences, labels = load_sequences("genomic_sequences.fasta")
```

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing

We'll convert our sequences into a one-hot encoded format and split the dataset.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

def one_hot_encode(sequences):
    encoding = []
    for seq in sequences:
        encoding.append([1 if char == 'A' else 0 for char in seq])  # A only, extend as needed
    return np.array(encoding)

X_encoded = one_hot_encode(sequences)
y = np.array(labels)

# Split the dataset into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_encoded, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 3: Build the Neural Network Model

We will use TensorFlow to build a simple fully connected neural network.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Output layer for binary classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## Step 4: Train the Model

Now we can fit the model to our training data.

```python
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

## Step 5: Evaluate the Model

After training, we can evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {loss}, Test Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

## Step 6: Make Predictions

Lastly, let's predict the presence of the gene in new sequences.

```python
def predict_sequences(new_sequences):
    new_encoded = one_hot_encode(new_sequences)
    predictions = model.predict(new_encoded)
    return (predictions > 0.5).astype(int)

# Example usage
new_sequences = ["ATCG", "GGTA"]
predictions = predict_sequences(new_sequences)
print(predictions)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to use Python, Biopython, and TensorFlow to build a simple model for predicting gene presence within genomic data. Further optimizations and more complex architectures can be explored for better accuracy and robustness.
