# Question
How can we use Python to perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics using the Biopython library?

# Solution

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Biopython installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't done so:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Overview
Sequence alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics for identifying regions of similarity in sequences. We will use the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment.

## Code Example

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

# Load sequences from a FASTA file
def load_sequences(fasta_file):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(record.seq)
    return sequences

# Perform global alignment
def global_alignment(seq1, seq2):
    alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)
    best_alignment = alignments[0]
    return format_alignment(*best_alignment)

# Main function
def main():
    fasta_file = "sequences.fasta"  # Example FASTA file containing sequences
    sequences = load_sequences(fasta_file)
    
    if len(sequences) < 2:
        print("Please provide at least two sequences for alignment.")
        return
    
    alignment_result = global_alignment(sequences[0], sequences[1])
    print("Global Alignment Result:")
    print(alignment_result)

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation
1. **load_sequences**: This function reads in sequences from a FASTA file and returns a list of sequences.
2. **global_alignment**: This function performs global sequence alignment using the `pairwise2` module from Biopython and returns the best alignment formatted as a string.
3. **main**: This function acts as the entry point, where sequences are loaded, and alignment is performed.

## Testing the Code
Create a FASTA file `sequences.fasta` with the following content:

```
>sequence_1
AGCTGAC
>sequence_2
AGCTAGC
```

Run the script, and you should see the aligned sequences printed as output.
