# Question
How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences and identify potential mutations associated with a disease?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use Python to load genomic sequence data, compare sequences, and identify potential mutations that may be linked to a specific disease. We will utilize libraries such as Biopython, pandas, and NumPy.

### Requirements
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't done so:

```bash
pip install biopython pandas numpy
```

### Step 1: Load Genomic Sequences

First, we need to load our genomic sequences. We will use three sample sequences in FASTA format.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

# Load genomic sequences from a FASTA file
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = {}
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences[record.id] = str(record.seq)
    return sequences

# Example usage
sequences = load_sequences("genomic_sequences.fasta")
print(sequences)
```

### Step 2: Identify Mutations

Next, we will define a function to compare two sequences and identify mutations.

```python
def identify_mutations(seq1, seq2):
    mutations = []
    for i in range(min(len(seq1), len(seq2))):
        if seq1[i] != seq2[i]:
            mutations.append((i, seq1[i], seq2[i]))  # (position, base_in_seq1, base_in_seq2)
    return mutations

# Example usage
seq_reference = sequences['reference']
seq_patient = sequences['patient']
mutations = identify_mutations(seq_reference, seq_patient)
print(f"Identified mutations: {mutations}")
```

### Step 3: Analyze Mutation Impact

Now, let's consider how to analyze the potential impact of these mutations. For simplicity, let’s assume we have a predefined list of mutations known to be associated with a disease.

```python
# Dummy mutation impact data
mutation_impact = {
    "A>T": "likely pathogenic",
    "C>G": "variant of uncertain significance",
    "G>C": "benign"
}

def analyze_mutations(mutations):
    impact_results = {}
    for pos, base_ref, base_pat in mutations:
        mutation = f"{base_ref}>{base_pat}"
        impact = mutation_impact.get(mutation, "unknown")
        impact_results[mutation] = impact
    return impact_results

# Example usage
impact_results = analyze_mutations(mutations)
print(f"Mutation impact analysis: {impact_results}")
```

### Final Output

Combine everything into a single execution block for convenience.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sequences = load_sequences("genomic_sequences.fasta")
    seq_reference = sequences['reference']
    seq_patient = sequences['patient']

    mutations = identify_mutations(seq_reference, seq_patient)
    print(f"Identified mutations: {mutations}")

    impact_results = analyze_mutations(mutations)
    print(f"Mutation impact analysis: {impact_results}")
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to load genomic sequences, identify mutations, and analyze their potential impact on health using Python. This workflow can be expanded with real genomic data and more sophisticated analyses for deeper insights into bioinformatics research.
