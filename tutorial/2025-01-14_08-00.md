# Advanced AI in Bioinformatics: Disease Prediction Using Gene Expression Data

## Question
How can we use machine learning to predict diseases based on gene expression data using Python?

## Solution
In this tutorial, we will build a predictive model to classify patients into two categories (diseased or healthy) based on their gene expression levels using a Random Forest classifier.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### Step 2: Load the Data
Assuming we have a CSV file `gene_expression_data.csv` with gene expression levels and a label for disease status.

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Separate features (gene expression levels) and the target variable (disease status).

```python
# Assume the last column is the target variable
X = data.iloc[:, :-1]  # Features
y = data.iloc[:, -1]   # Target variable
```

### Step 4: Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Build the Random Forest Model
Fit a Random Forest classifier on the training set.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Make Predictions
Use the model to make predictions on the test set.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 7: Evaluate the Model
Generate a classification report and confusion matrix for the predictions.

```python
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Confusion Matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=['Healthy', 'Diseased'], yticklabels=['Healthy', 'Diseased'])
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to preprocess gene expression data, build a Random Forest model, and evaluate its performance for disease prediction. You can enhance this model by tuning hyperparameters, performing feature selection, or experimenting with different algorithms.
