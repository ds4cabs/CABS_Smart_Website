# Question
How can we use Python to analyze DNA sequences for patterns and mutations using advanced AI techniques in bioinformatics?

# Solution

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install biopython numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Step 2: Load and Preprocess DNA Sequence Data

We will use Biopython to handle DNA sequences. Let's create a sample DNA sequence dataset.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
import pandas as pd

# Load DNA sequence data
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append({'id': record.id, 'sequence': str(record.seq)})
    return pd.DataFrame(sequences)

# Sample FASTA file name
fasta_file = 'sample_dna_sequences.fasta'
dna_data = load_sequences(fasta_file)
print(dna_data.head())
```

## Step 3: Feature Extraction

Extract features such as GC content, sequence length, and k-mer frequencies.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Function to calculate GC content
def gc_content(sequence):
    return (sequence.count('G') + sequence.count('C')) / len(sequence) 

# Feature extraction
def extract_features(df):
    df['gc_content'] = df['sequence'].apply(gc_content)
    df['length'] = df['sequence'].apply(len)

    # Extracting k-mers (for k=5)
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer(analyzer='char', ngram_range=(5, 5))
    kmer_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['sequence'])
    
    # Convert to DataFrame
    kmer_df = pd.DataFrame(kmer_matrix.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
    return pd.concat([df, kmer_df], axis=1)

dna_features = extract_features(dna_data)
print(dna_features.head())
```

## Step 4: Train an AI Model

Now, we will use a machine learning model to classify the sequences based on their features. We will use a Random Forest classifier.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Prepare data for training
X = dna_features.drop(['id', 'sequence'], axis=1)
y = [1 if 'mutation' in id else 0 for id in dna_features['id']]  # Example target labels

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the Random Forest model
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 5: Evaluate the Model

Finally, evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
print('Confusion Matrix:\n', conf_matrix)
print('Classification Report:\n', class_report)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we loaded DNA sequences, extracted features, trained a Random Forest model, and evaluated its performance. You can further enhance this analysis by exploring deep learning techniques or integrating more complex features.
