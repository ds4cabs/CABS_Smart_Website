# Question: How can we use Python to analyze genomic sequences for identifying potential mutations associated with a specific disease?

# Solution

In this tutorial, we will develop a Python script that leverages the Biopython library to analyze genomic sequences. We will identify potential mutations by comparing a reference sequence to a given genomic sequence.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the Biopython library. You can install Biopython using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio import pairwise2
```

## Step 2: Load Reference and Genomic Sequences

Assuming you have two FASTA files: `reference.fasta` and `genomic.fasta`. The `reference.fasta` contains the reference sequence, while `genomic.fasta` holds the genomic sequence of the individual.

```python
def load_sequences(reference_file, genomic_file):
    reference_seq = SeqIO.read(reference_file, "fasta").seq
    genomic_seq = SeqIO.read(genomic_file, "fasta").seq
    return reference_seq, genomic_seq
```

## Step 3: Align Sequences and Identify Mutations

We will perform pairwise alignment to find differences between the sequences and identify potential mutations.

```python
def find_mutations(reference_seq, genomic_seq):
    alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(reference_seq, genomic_seq)
    best_alignment = alignments[0]
    ref_aligned, genomic_aligned, _, _, _ = best_alignment

    mutations = []
    for ref_char, genomic_char in zip(ref_aligned, genomic_aligned):
        if ref_char != genomic_char:
            mutations.append((ref_char, genomic_char))
    return mutations
```

## Step 4: Main Function to Execute the Analysis

```python
def main():
    reference_file = "reference.fasta"
    genomic_file = "genomic.fasta"

    reference_seq, genomic_seq = load_sequences(reference_file, genomic_file)
    mutations = find_mutations(reference_seq, genomic_seq)

    print("Identified Mutations:")
    for ref, geno in mutations:
        print(f"Reference: {ref} -> Genomic: {geno}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Step 5: Running the Script

Save the script as `mutation_analysis.py` and run it using:

```bash
python mutation_analysis.py
```

## Conclusion

This script provides a simple way to identify mutations in genomic sequences compared to a reference. For more advanced analysis, consider integrating additional bioinformatics tools or databases to correlate mutations with specific diseases.
