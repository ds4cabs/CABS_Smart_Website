## Question: 
How can we use Python to perform sequence alignment in bioinformatics using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm?

## Solution:

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for global sequence alignment. In this example, we will write a Python implementation to align two DNA sequences. 

### Step-by-step Implementation:

1. **Define the scoring system**:
   - Match score: +1
   - Mismatch score: -1
   - Gap penalty: -1

2. **Initialize the scoring matrix**.

3. **Fill in the scoring matrix** according to the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

4. **Backtrack to find the optimal alignment**.

### Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2, match=1, mismatch=-1, gap=-1):
    # Step 1: Initialize scoring matrix
    n, m = len(seq1), len(seq2)
    score_matrix = np.zeros((n + 1, m + 1))
    
    # Fill the first row and first column
    for i in range(n + 1):
        score_matrix[i][0] = gap * i
    for j in range(m + 1):
        score_matrix[0][j] = gap * j

    # Step 2: Fill the scoring matrix
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            match_score = score_matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + (match if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1] else mismatch)
            delete_score = score_matrix[i - 1][j] + gap
            insert_score = score_matrix[i][j - 1] + gap
            
            score_matrix[i][j] = max(match_score, delete_score, insert_score)

    # Step 3: Backtrack to find the optimal alignment
    aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2 = '', ''
    i, j = n, m

    while i > 0 or j > 0:
        current_score = score_matrix[i][j]
        if i > 0 and j > 0 and current_score == score_matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + (match if seq1[i - 1] == seq2[j - 1] else mismatch):
            aligned_seq1 += seq1[i - 1]
            aligned_seq2 += seq2[j - 1]
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif i > 0 and current_score == score_matrix[i - 1][j] + gap:
            aligned_seq1 += seq1[i - 1]
            aligned_seq2 += '-'
            i -= 1
        else:
            aligned_seq1 += '-'
            aligned_seq2 += seq2[j - 1]
            j -= 1

    # Reverse the alignments as they are constructed backwards
    return aligned_seq1[::-1], aligned_seq2[::-1]

# Example Usage
seq1 = "AGCTG"
seq2 = "AGCT"
aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2 = needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2)
print("Aligned Sequence 1:", aligned_seq1)
print("Aligned Sequence 2:", aligned_seq2)
```

### Explanation:
- This implementation defines a scoring matrix and fills it according to the alignment scores based on matches, mismatches, and gaps.
- The backtracking part constructs the optimal aligned sequences from the filled scoring matrix.
- In the end, we provide both sequences aligned to visualize similarities and differences. 

### Output:
```plaintext
Aligned Sequence 1: AGCTG
Aligned Sequence 2: AGCT-
```
