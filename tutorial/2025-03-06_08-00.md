# Tutorial: Advanced AI in Bioinformatics - Predicting Protein Structure

## Question
How can we use Python to predict protein structure using a neural network model based on sequence data?

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn keras tensorflow biopython
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 3: Load the Dataset
We will use a hypothetical dataset consisting of amino acid sequences and their corresponding structures.

```python
# Load your dataset
def load_data(file_path):
    sequences = []
    labels = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append(str(record.seq))
        labels.append(record.description.split()[1])  # Assuming structure info is in the description
    return sequences, labels

sequences, labels = load_data("protein_sequences.fasta")
```

### Step 4: Encode Sequences
We need to encode amino acid sequences into a format suitable for training (one-hot encoding).

```python
def one_hot_encode(sequences):
    amino_acids = 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'
    mapping = {aa: i for i, aa in enumerate(amino_acids)}

    encoded_sequences = []
    for seq in sequences:
        encoding = np.zeros((len(seq), len(amino_acids)))
        for i, aa in enumerate(seq):
            if aa in mapping:
                encoding[i, mapping[aa]] = 1
        encoded_sequences.append(encoding)
    
    return np.array(encoded_sequences)

X = one_hot_encode(sequences)
y = pd.get_dummies(labels).values  # One hot encoding the labels
```

### Step 5: Split the Dataset

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 6: Build the Neural Network

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(128, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]), activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(y_train.shape[1], activation='softmax'))

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Step 7: Train the Model

```python
# Reshape the input for the model
X_train_reshaped = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], -1)
model.fit(X_train_reshaped, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Save the model
model.save("protein_structure_predictor.h5")
```

### Step 8: Evaluate the Model

```python
X_test_reshaped = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], -1)
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_reshaped, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}')
```

### Conclusion
This tutorial outlined the process of predicting protein structures from sequences using a simple neural network in Python. You can enhance the model by exploring different architectures and hyperparameters.
