# How can we use Python for genomic data analysis in bioinformatics?

## Solution

In this tutorial, we will analyze genomic data using Python libraries such as Biopython and Pandas. We will perform basic operations like reading sequence data, calculating GC content, and visualizing the distribution of GC content across sequences.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install biopython pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from Bio import SeqIO
```

### Step 2: Load Genomic Data

Assuming you have a FASTA file named `sequences.fasta`, we will load the sequences from this file.

```python
def load_sequences(file_path):
    sequences = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
        sequences.append((record.id, str(record.seq)))
    return pd.DataFrame(sequences, columns=['ID', 'Sequence'])

# Load sequences
df_sequences = load_sequences("sequences.fasta")
print(df_sequences.head())
```

### Step 3: Calculate GC Content

We will define a function to calculate the GC content of the sequences.

```python
def calculate_gc_content(sequence):
    g_count = sequence.count('G')
    c_count = sequence.count('C')
    total_count = len(sequence)
    return (g_count + c_count) / total_count * 100  # Returns GC content as a percentage

# Apply the GC content calculation
df_sequences['GC_Content'] = df_sequences['Sequence'].apply(calculate_gc_content)
```

### Step 4: Visualize the GC Content Distribution

We will use seaborn to create a distribution plot of the GC content.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df_sequences['GC_Content'], bins=20, kde=True, color='blue')
plt.title('GC Content Distribution')
plt.xlabel('GC Content (%)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

### Summary

In this tutorial, we have:

1. Loaded genomic data from a FASTA file using Biopython.
2. Calculated GC content for each sequence.
3. Visualized the distribution of GC content across all sequences.

This basic pipeline can be extended to include more sophisticated analyses in bioinformatics.
