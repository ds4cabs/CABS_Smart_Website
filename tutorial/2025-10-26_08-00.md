# How to Use Python for DNA Sequence Analysis in Bioinformatics?

## Question
How can we analyze DNA sequences to compute the GC content and identify the presence of restriction enzyme recognition sites using Python?

## Solution

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the `Bio` module from Biopython. You can install it using:
```bash
pip install biopython
```

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

1. **Import Libraries**
   ```python
   from Bio.Seq import Seq
   from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
   ```

2. **Define the DNA Sequence**
   ```python
   # Example DNA sequence
   dna_sequence = "AGCTTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGC"
   ```

3. **Calculate GC Content**
   ```python
   def calculate_gc_content(sequence):
       return GC(sequence)

   gc_content = calculate_gc_content(dna_sequence)
   print(f"GC Content: {gc_content:.2f}%")
   ```

4. **Identify Restriction Sites**
   ```python
   # List of common restriction enzyme recognition sites
   restriction_sites = {
       "EcoRI": "GAATTC",
       "HindIII": "AAGCTT",
       "BamHI": "GGATCC"
   }

   def find_restriction_sites(sequence, sites):
       found_sites = {}
       for enzyme, site in sites.items():
           if site in sequence:
               found_sites[enzyme] = sequence.count(site)
       return found_sites

   found_sites = find_restriction_sites(dna_sequence, restriction_sites)
   ```

5. **Display Results**
   ```python
   print(f"Found Restriction Sites: {found_sites}")
   ```

### Full Code
```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC

# Example DNA sequence
dna_sequence = "AGCTTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGC"

def calculate_gc_content(sequence):
    return GC(sequence)

gc_content = calculate_gc_content(dna_sequence)
print(f"GC Content: {gc_content:.2f}%")

restriction_sites = {
    "EcoRI": "GAATTC",
    "HindIII": "AAGCTT",
    "BamHI": "GGATCC"
}

def find_restriction_sites(sequence, sites):
    found_sites = {}
    for enzyme, site in sites.items():
        if site in sequence:
            found_sites[enzyme] = sequence.count(site)
    return found_sites

found_sites = find_restriction_sites(dna_sequence, restriction_sites)
print(f"Found Restriction Sites: {found_sites}")
```

### Conclusion
This tutorial demonstrated how to compute the GC content and identify restriction enzyme sites in a DNA sequence using Python. This foundational knowledge can be applied in various bioinformatics applications.
